        buckle-straps and nothing else, and meet <br /> the Frenchman, who struck
        him with a sword in the presence of Talbot. <br /> The other, story is

        his departure the girl's mother perceived the <br /> condition of her
        daughter, and the girl confessed in what state she was; <br /> so her
        mother sent her to the Picardian to tell him that he must undo <br />
        that which he had done. And how his new bride refused then to sleep with

    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The highest living authority on French Literature&mdash;Professor George
      Saintsbury&mdash;has said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The <i>Cent Nouvelles</i> is undoubtedly the first work of literary prose
      in French, and the first, moreover, of a long and most remarkable series
      of literary works in which French writers may challenge all comers with
      the certainty of victory. The short prose tale of a comic character is the
      one French literary product the pre-eminence and perfection of which it is
      impossible to dispute, and the prose tale first appears to advantage in
      the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>. The subjects are by no means new.
      They are simply the old themes of the <i>fabliaux</i> treated in the old
      way. The novelty is in the application of prose to such a purpose, and in
      the crispness, the fluency, and the elegance, of the prose used."
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the literary merits which the eminent critic has pointed out, the
      stories give us curious glimpses of life in the 15th Century. We get a
      genuine view of the social condition of the nobility and the middle
      classes, and are pleasantly surprised to learn from the mouths of the
      nobles themselves that the peasant was not the down-trodden serf that we
      should have expected to find him a century after the Jacquerie, and 350
      years before the Revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact there is an atmosphere of tolerance, not to say <i>bonhommie</i>
      about these stories which is very remarkable when we consider under what
      circumstances they were told, and by whom, and to whom.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seems to have struck M. Lenient, a French critic, who says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Generally the incidents and personages belong to the <i>bourgeoisée</i>;
      there is nothing chivalric, nothing wonderful; no dreamy lovers, romantic
      dames, fairies, or enchanters. Noble dames, bourgeois, nuns, knights,
      merchants, monks, and peasants mutually dupe each other. The lord deceives
      the miller's wife by imposing on her simplicity, and the miller retaliates
      in much the same manner. The shepherd marries the knight's sister, and the
      nobleman is not over scandalized.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The vices of the monks are depicted in half a score tales, and the
      seducers are punished with a severity not always in proportion to the
      offence."
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems curious that this valuable and interesting work has never before
      been translated into English during the four and a half centuries the book
      has been in existence. This is the more remarkable as the work was edited
      in French by an English scholar&mdash;the late Thomas Wright. It can
      hardly be the coarseness of some of the stories which has prevented the <i>Nouvelles</i>
      from being presented to English readers when there are half a dozen
      versions of the <i>Heptameron</i>, which is quite as coarse as the <i>Cent
      Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>, does not possess the same historical interest,
      and is not to be compared to the present work as regards either the
      stories or the style.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to this, there is the history of the book itself, and its
      connection with one of the most important personages in French history&mdash;Louis
      XI. Indeed, in many French and English works of reference, the authorship
      of the <i>Nouvelles</i> has been attributed to him, and though in recent
      years, the writer is now believed&mdash;and no doubt correctly&mdash;to
      have been Antoine de la Salle, it is tolerably certain that Prince Louis
      heard all the stories related, and very possibly contributed several of
      them. The circumstances under which these stories came to be narrated
      requires a few words of explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a very early age, Louis showed those qualities by which he was later
      distinguished. When he was only fourteen, he caused his father, Charles
      VII, much grief, both by his unfilial conduct and his behaviour to the
      beautiful Agnes Sorel, the King's mistress, towards whom he felt an
      implacable hatred. He is said to have slapped her face, because he thought
      she did not treat him with proper respect. This blow was, it is asserted,
      the primary cause of his revolt against his father's authority (1440). The
      rebellion was put down, and the Prince was pardoned, but relations between
      father and son were still strained, and in 1446, Louis had to betake
      himself to his appanage of Dauphiné, where he remained for ten years,
      always plotting and scheming, and braving his father's authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the Prince's Court at Grenoble became the seat of so many
      conspiracies that Charles VII was obliged to take forcible measures. It
      was small wonder that the King's patience was exhausted. Louis, not
      content with the rule of his province, had made attempts to win over many
      of the nobility, and to bribe the archers of the Scotch Guard. Though not
      liberal as a rule, he had also expended large sums to different secret
      agents for some specific purpose, which was in all probability to secure
      his father's death, for he was not the sort of man to stick at parricide
      even, if it would secure his ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plot was revealed to Charles by Antoine de Chabannes, Comte de
      Dampmartin. Louis, when taxed with his misconduct, impudently denied that
      he had been mixed up with the conspiracy, but denounced all his
      accomplices, and allowed them to suffer for his misdeeds. He did not,
      however, forget to revenge them, so far as lay in his power. The fair
      Agnès Sorel, whom he had always regarded as his bitterest enemy, died
      shortly afterwards at Jumièges, and it has always been believed, and with
      great show of reason, that she was poisoned by his orders. He was not able
      to take vengeance on Antoine de Chabannes until after he became King.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding that his plots were of no avail, he essayed to get together an
      army large enough to combat his father, but before he completed his plans,
      Charles VII, tired of his endless treason and trickery, sent an army,
      under the faithful de Chabannes, into the Dauphiné, with orders to arrest
      the Dauphin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The forces which Louis had at his disposal were numerically so much
      weaker, that he did not dare to risk a battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If God or fortune," he cried, "had been kind enough to give me but half
      the men-at-arms which now belong to the King, my father, and will be mine
      some day, by Our Lady, my mistress, I would have spared him the trouble of
      coming so far to seek me, but would have met him and fought him at Lyon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not having sufficient forces, and feeling that he could not hope for fresh
      pardon, he resolved to fly from France, and take refuge at the Court of
      the Duke of Burgundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day in June, 1456, he pretended to go hunting, and then, attended by
      only half a dozen friends, rode as fast as he could into Burgundian
      territory, and arrived at Saint Claude.
    </p>
    <p>
      From there he wrote to his father, excusing his flight, and announcing his
      intention of joining an expedition which Philippe le Bon, the reigning
      Duke of Burgundy was about to undertake against the Turks. The Duke was at
      that moment besieging Utrecht, but as soon as he heard the Dauphin had
      arrived in his dominions, he sent orders that he was to be conducted to
      Brussels with all the honours befitting his rank and station.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly afterwards the Duke returned, and listened with real or pretended
      sympathy to all the complaints that Louis made against his father, but put
      a damper on any hopes that the Prince may have entertained of getting the
      Burgundian forces to support his cause, by saying;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur, you are welcome to my domains. I am happy to see you here. I
      will provide you with men and money for any purpose you may require,
      except to be employed against the King, your father, whom I would on no
      account displease."
    </p>
    <p>
      Duke Philippe even tried to bring about a reconciliation between Charles
      and his son; but as Louis was not very anxious to return to France, nor
      Charles to have him there, and a good many of the nobles were far from
      desiring that the Prince should come back, the negotiations came to
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis could make himself agreeable when he pleased, and during his stay in
      the Duke's domains, he was on good terms with Philippe le Bon, who granted
      him 3000 gold florins a month, and the castle of Genappe as a residence.
      This castle was situated on the Dyle, midway between Brussels and Louvain,
      and about eight miles from either city. The river, or a deep moat,
      surrounded the castle on every side. There was a drawbridge which was
      drawn up at night, so Louis felt himself quite safe from any attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he remained five years (1456-1461) until the death of his father
      placed him on the throne of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was during these five years that these stories were told to amuse his
      leisure. Probably there were many more than a hundred narrated&mdash;perhaps
      several hundreds&mdash;but the literary man who afterwards "edited" the
      stories only selected those which he deemed best, or, perhaps, those he
      heard recounted. The narrators were the nobles who formed the Dauphin's
      Court. Much ink has been spilled over the question whether Louis himself
      had any share in the production. In nearly every case the author's name is
      given, and ten of them (Nos. 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 29, 33, 69, 70 and 71) are
      described in the original edition as being by "Monseigneur." Publishers of
      subsequent editions brought out at the close of the 15th, or the beginning
      of the 16th, Century, jumped to the conclusion that "Monseigneur" was
      really the Dauphin, who not only contributed largely to the book, but
      after he became King personally supervised the publication of the
      collected stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      For four centuries Louis XI was credited with the authorship of the tales
      mentioned. The first person&mdash;so far as I am aware&mdash;to throw any
      doubt on his claim was the late Mr. Thomas Wright, who edited an edition
      of the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>, published by Jannet, Paris, 1858.
      He maintained, with some show of reason, that as the stories were told in
      Burgundy, by Burgundians, and the collected tales were "edited" by a
      subject of the Duke (Antoine de la Salle, of whom I shall have occasion to
      speak shortly) it was more probable that "Monseigneur" would mean the Duke
      than the Dauphin, and he therefore ascribed the stories to Philippe le
      Bel. Modern French scholars, however, appear to be of opinion that
      "Monseigneur" was the Comte de Charolais, who afterwards became famous as
      Charles le Téméraire, the last Duke of Burgundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two great enemies were at that time close friends, and Charles was a
      very frequent visitor to Genappe. It was not very likely, they say, that
      Duke Philippe who was an old man would have bothered himself to tell his
      guest indecent stories. On the other hand, Charles, being then only Comte
      de Charolais, had no right to the title of "Monseigneur," but they parry
      that difficulty by supposing that as he became Duke before the tales were
      printed, the title was given him in the first printed edition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter is one which will, perhaps, never be satisfactorily settled. My
      own opinion&mdash;though I claim for it no weight or value&mdash;is that
      Louis appears to have the greatest right to the stories, though in support
      of that theory I can only adduce some arguments, which if separately weak
      may have some weight when taken collectively. Vérard, who published the
      first edition, says in the Dedication; "Et notez que par toutes les
      Nouvelles où il est dit par Monseigneur il est entendu par Monseigneur le
      Dauphin, lequel depuis a succédé à la couronne et est le roy Loys unsieme;
      car il estoit lors es pays du duc de Bourgoingne."
    </p>
    <p>
      The critics may have good reason for throwing doubt on Vérard's statement,
      but unless he printed his edition from a M.S. made after 1467, and the
      copyist had altered the name of the Comte de Charolais to "Monseigneur" it
      is not easy to see how the error arose, whilst on the other hand, as
      Vérard had every facility for knowing the truth, and some of the copies
      must have been purchased by persons who were present when the stories were
      told, the mistake would have been rectified in the subsequent editions
      that Vérard brought out in the course of the next few years, when Louis
      had been long dead and there was no necessity to flatter his vanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      On examining the stories related by "Monseigneur," it seems to me that
      there is some slight internal evidence that they were told by Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brantôme says of him that, "he loved to hear tales of loose women, and had
      but a poor opinion of woman and did not believe they were all chaste.
      (This sounds well coming from Brantôme) Anyone who could relate such tales
      was gladly welcomed by the Prince, who would have given all Homer and
      Virgil too for a funny story." The Prince must have heard many such
      stories, and would be likely to repeat them, and we find the first half
      dozen stories are decidedly "broad," (No XI was afterwards appropriated by
      Rabelais, as "Hans Carvel's Ring") and we may suspect that Louis tried to
      show the different narrators by personal example what he considered a
      really "good tale."
    </p>
    <p>
      We know also Louis was subject to fits of religious melancholy, and
      evinced a superstitious veneration for holy things, and even wore little,
      leaden images of the saints round his hat. In many of the stories we find
      monks punished for their immorality, or laughed at for their ignorance,
      and nowhere do we see any particular veneration displayed for the Church.
      The only exception is No LXX, "The Devil's Horn," in which a knight by
      sheer faith in the mystery of baptism vanquishes the Devil, whereas one of
      the knight's retainers, armed with a battle-axe but not possessing his
      master's robust faith in the efficacy of holy water, is carried off
      bodily, and never heard of again. It seems to me that this story bears the
      stamp of the character of Louis, who though suspicious towards men, was
      childishly credulous in religious matters, but I leave the question for
      critics more capable than I to decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the thirty-two noblemen or squires who contributed the other stories,
      mention will be made in the notes. Of the stories, I may here mention that
      14 or 15 were taken from Boccaccio, and as many more from Poggio or other
      Italian writers, or French <i>fabliaux</i>, but about 70 of them appear to
      be original.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knights and squires who told the stories had probably no great skill
      as <i>raconteurs</i>, and perhaps did not read or write very fluently. The
      tales were written down afterwards by a literary man, and they owe "the
      crispness, fluency, and elegance," which, as Prof. Saintsbury remarks,
      they possess in such a striking degree, to the genius of Antoine de la
      Sale. He was born in 1398 in Burgundy or Touraine. He had travelled much
      in Italy, and lived for some years at the Court of the Comte d' Anjou. He
      returned to Burgundy later, and was, apparently, given some sort of
      literary employment by Duke Philippe le Bel. At any rate he was appointed
      by Philippe or Louis to record the stories that enlivened the evenings at
      the Castle of Genappe, and the choice could not have fallen on a better
      man. He was already known as the author of two or three books, one of
      which&mdash;<i>Les Quinze Joyes de Mariage</i>&mdash;relates the woes of
      married life, and displays a knowledge of character, and a quaint,
      satirical humour that are truly remarkable, and remind the reader
      alternately of Thackeray and Douglas Jerrold,&mdash;indeed some of the
      Fifteen Joys are "Curtain Lectures" with a mediaeval environment, and the
      word pictures of Woman's foibles, follies, and failings are as bright
      to-day as when they were penned exactly 450 years ago. They show that the
      "Eternal Feminine" has not altered in five centuries&mdash;perhaps not in
      five thousand!
    </p>
    <p>
      The practised and facile pen of Antoine de la Sale clothed the dry bones
      of these stories with flesh and blood, and made them live, and move.
      Considering his undoubted gifts as a humourist, and a delineator of
      character it is strange that the name of Antoine de la Sale is not held in
      higher veneration by his countrymen, for he was the earliest exponent of a
      form of literary art in which the French have always excelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In making a translation of these stories I at first determined to adhere
      as closely as possible to the text, but found that the versions differed
      greatly. I have followed the two best modern editions, and have made as
      few changes and omissions as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three or four of the stories are extremely coarse, and I hesitated whether
      to omit them, insert them in the original French, or translate them, but
      decided that as the book would only be read by persons of education,
      respectability, and mature age, it was better to translate them fully,&mdash;as
      has been done in the case of the far coarser passages of Rabelais and
      other writers. This course appeared to me less hypocritical than that
      adopted in a recent expensive edition of Boccaccio in which the story of
      Rusticus and Alibech was given in French&mdash;with a highly suggestive
      full-page illustration facing the text for the benefit of those who could
      not read the French language.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur Le Duc
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>The first story tells of how one found means to enjoy the wife of his
        neighbour, whose husband he had sent away in order that he might have
        her the more easily, and how the husband returning from his journey,
        found his friend bathing with his wife. And not knowing who she was, he
        wished to see her, but was permitted only to see her back&mdash;, and
        then thought that she resembled his wife, but dared not believe it. And
        thereupon left and found his wife at home, she having escaped by a
        postern door, and related to her his suspicions.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the town of Valenciennes there lived formerly a notable citizen, who
      had been receiver of Hainault, who was renowned amongst all others for his
      prudence and discretion, and amongst his praiseworthy virtues, liberality
      was not the least, and thus it came to pass that he enjoyed the grace of
      princes, lords, and other persons of good estate. And this happy
      condition, Fortune granted and preserved to him to the end of his days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both before and after death unloosed him from the chains of matrimony, the
      good citizen mentioned in this Story, was not so badly lodged in the said
      town but that many a great lord would have been content and honoured to
      have such a lodging. His house faced several streets, in one of which was
      a little postern door, opposite to which lived a good comrade of his, who
      had a pretty wife, still young and charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, as is customary, her eyes, the archers of the heart, shot so many
      arrows into the said citizen, that unless he found some present remedy, he
      felt his case was no less than mortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      To more surely prevent such a fate, he found many and subtle manners of
      making the good comrade, the husband of the said quean, his private and
      familiar friend, so, that few of the dinners, suppers, banquets, baths,
      and other such amusements took place, either in the hotel or elsewhere,
      without his company. And of such favours his comrade was very proud, and
      also happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When our citizen, who was more cunning than a fox, had gained the
      good-will of his friend, little was needed to win the love of his wife,
      and in a few days he had worked so much and so well that the gallant lady
      was fain to hear his case, and to provide a suitable remedy thereto. It
      remained but to provide time and place; and for this she promised him
      that, whenever her husband lay abroad for a night, she would advise him
      thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wished-for day arrived when the husband told his wife that he was
      going to a chateau some three leagues distant from Valenciennes, and
      charged her to look after the house and keep within doors, because his
      business would not permit him to return that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      It need not be asked if she was joyful, though she showed it not either in
      word, or deed, or otherwise. Her husband had not journeyed a league before
      the citizen knew that the opportunity had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caused the baths to be brought forth, and the stoves to be heated, and
      pasties, tarts, and hippocras, and all the rest of God's good gifts, to be
      prepared largely and magnificently.
    </p>
    <p>
      When evening came, the postern door was unlocked, and she who was expected
      entered thereby, and God knows if she was not kindly received. I pass over
      all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they ascended into a chamber, and washed in a bath, by the side of
      which a good supper was quickly laid and served. And God knows if they
      drank often and deeply. To speak of the wines and viands would be a waste
      of time, and, to cut the story short, there was plenty of everything. In
      this most happy condition passed the great part of this sweet but short
      night; kisses often given and often returned, until they desired nothing
      but to go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst they were thus making good cheer, the husband returned from his
      journey, and knowing nothing of this adventure, knocked loudly at the door
      of the house. And the company that was in the ante-chamber refused him
      entrance until he should name his surety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he gave his name loud and clear, and so his good wife and the citizen
      heard him and knew him. She was so amazed to hear the voice of her husband
      that her loyal heart almost failed her; and she would have fainted, had
      not the good citizen and his servants comforted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good citizen being calm and well advised how to act, made haste to put
      her to bed, and lay close by her; and charged her well that she should lie
      close to him and hide her face, so that no one could see it. And that
      being done as quickly as may be, yet without too much haste, he ordered
      that the door should be opened. Then his good comrade sprang into the
      room, thinking to himself that there must be some mystery, else they had
      not kept him out of the room. And when he saw the table laid with wines
      and goodly viands, also the bath finely prepared, and the citizen in a
      handsome bed, well curtained, with a second person by his side, God knows
      he spoke loudly, and praised the good cheer of his neighbour. He called
      him rascal, and whore-monger, and drunkard, and many other names, which
      made those who were in the chamber laugh long and loud; but his wife could
      not join in the mirth, her face being pressed to the side of her new
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" said the husband, "Master whore-monger, you have well hidden from me
      this good cheer; but, by my faith, though I was not at the feast, you must
      show me the bride."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that, holding a candle in his hand, he drew near the bed, and
      would have withdrawn the coverlet, under which, in fear and silence, lay
      his most good and perfect wife, when the citizen and his servants
      prevented him; but he was not content, and would by force, in spite of
      them all, have laid his hand upon the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not master there, and could not have his will, and for good
      cause, and was fain to be content with a most gracious proposal which was
      made to him, and which was this, that he should be shown the backside of
      his wife, and her haunches, and thighs&mdash;which were big and white, and
      moreover fair and comely&mdash;without uncovering and beholding her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good comrade, still holding a candle in his hand, gazed for long
      without saying a word; and when he did speak, it was to praise highly the
      great beauty of that dame, and he swore by a great oath that he had never
      seen anything that so much resembled the back parts of his own wife, and
      that were he not well sure that she was at home at that time, he would
      have said it was she.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had by this somewhat recovered, and he drew back much disconcerted,
      but God knows that they all told him, first one and then the other, that
      he had judged wrongly, and spoken against the honour of his wife, and that
      this was some other woman, as he would afterwards see for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      To restore him to good humour, after they had thus abused his eyes, the
      citizen ordered that they should make him sit at the table, where he
      drowned his suspicions by eating and drinking of what was left of the
      supper, whilst they in the bed were robbing him of his honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time came to leave, and he said good night to the citizen and his
      companions, and begged they would let him leave by the postern door, that
      he might the sooner return home. But the citizen replied that he knew not
      then where to find the key; he thought also that the lock was so rusted
      that they could not open the door, which they rarely if ever used. He was
      content therefore to leave by the front gate, and make a long detour to
      reach his house, and whilst the servants of the citizen led him to the
      door, the good wife was quickly on her feet, and in a short time, clad in
      a simple sark, with her corset on her arm, and come to the postern. She
      made but one bound to her house, where she awaited her husband (who came
      by a longer way) well-prepared as to the manner in which she should
      receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon came our man, and seeing still a light in the house, knocked at the
      door loudly; and this good wife, who was pretending to clean the house,
      and had a besom in her hands, asked &mdash; what she knew well; "Who is
      there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he replied; "It is your husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband!" said she. "My husband is not here! He is not in the town!"
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he knocked again, and cried, "Open the door! I am your husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know my husband well," quoth she, "and it is not his custom to return
      home so late at night, when he is in the town. Go away, and do not knock
      here at this hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he knocked all the more, and called her by name once or twice. Yet she
      pretended not to know him, and asked why he came at that hour, but for all
      reply he said nothing but, "Open! Open!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open!" said she. "What! are you still there you rascally whore-monger? By
      St. Mary, I would rather see you drown than come in here! Go! and sleep as
      badly as you please in the place where you came from."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then her good husband grew angry, and thundered against the door as though
      he would knock the house down, and threatened to beat his wife, such was
      his rage,&mdash;of which she had not great fear; but at length, because of
      the noise he made, and that she might the better speak her mind to him,
      she opened the door, and when he entered, God knows whether he did not see
      an angry face, and have a warm greeting. For when her tongue found words
      from a heart overcharged with anger and indignation, her language was as
      sharp as well-ground Guingant razors.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, amongst other things, she reproached him that he had wickedly
      pretended a journey in order that he might try her, and that he was a
      coward and a recreant, unworthy to have such a wife as she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our good comrade, though he had been angry, saw how wrong he had been, and
      restrained his wrath, and the indignation that in his heart he had
      conceived when he was standing outside the door was turned aside. So he
      said, to excuse himself, and to satisfy his wife, that he had returned
      from his journey because he had forgotten a letter concerning the object
      of his going.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretending not to believe him, she invented more stories, and charged him
      with having frequented taverns and bagnios, and other improper and
      dissolute resorts, and that he behaved as no respectable man should, and
      she cursed the hour in which she had made his acquaintance, and doubly
      cursed the day she became his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor man, much grieved, seeing his wife more troubled than he liked,
      knew not what to say. And his suspicions being removed, he drew near her,
      weeping and falling upon his knees and made the following fine speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My most dear companion, and most loyal wife, I beg and pray of you to
      remove from your heart the wrath you have conceived against me, and pardon
      me for all that I have done against you. I own my fault, I see my error. I
      have come now from a place where they made good cheer, and where, I am
      ashamed to say, I fancied I recognised you, at which I was much
      displeased. And so I wrongfully and causelessly suspected you to be other
      than a good woman, of which I now repent bitterly, and pray of you to
      forgive me, and pardon my folly."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good woman, seeing her husband so contrite, showed no great anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said she, "You have come from filthy houses of ill-fame, and you
      dare to think that your honest wife would be seen in such places?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, my dear, I know you would not. For God's sake, say no more about
      it." said the good man, and repeated his aforesaid request.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, seeing his contrition, ceased her reproaches, and little by little
      regained her composure, and with much ado pardoned him, after he had made
      a hundred thousand oaths and promises to her who had so wronged him. And
      from that time forth she often, without fear or regret, passed the said
      postern, nor were her escapades discovered by him who was most concerned.
      And that suffices for the first story.

      STORY THE SECOND &mdash; THE MONK-DOCTOR.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>The second story, related by Duke Philip, is of a young girl who had
        piles, who put out the only eye he had of a Cordelier monk who was
        healing her, and of the lawsuit that followed thereon.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the chief town of England, called London, which is much resorted to by
      many folks, there lived, not long ago, a rich and powerful man who was a
      merchant and citizen, who beside his great wealth and treasures, was
      enriched by the possession of a fair daughter, whom God had given him over
      and above his substance, and who for goodness, prettiness, and gentleness,
      surpassed all others of her time, and who when she was fifteen was
      renowned for her virtue and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      God knows that many folk of good position desired and sought for her good
      grace by all the divers manners used by lovers,&mdash;which was no small
      pleasure to her father and mother, and increased their ardent and paternal
      affection for their beloved daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it happened that, either by the permission of God, or that Fortune
      willed and ordered it so, being envious and discontented at the prosperity
      of this beautiful girl, or of her parents, or all of them,&mdash;or may be
      from some secret and natural cause that I leave to doctors and
      philosophers to determine, that she was afflicted with an unpleasant and
      dangerous disease which is commonly called piles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy family was greatly troubled when they found the fawn they so
      dearly loved, set on by the sleuth-hounds and beagles of this unpleasant
      disease, which had, moreover, attacked its prey in a dangerous place. The
      poor girl&mdash;utterly cast down by this great misfortune,&mdash;could do
      naught else than weep and sigh. Her grief-stricken mother was much
      troubled; and her father, greatly vexed, wrung his hands, and tore his
      hair in his rage at this fresh misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Need I say that all the pride of that household was suddenly cast down to
      the ground, and in one moment converted into bitter and great grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relations, friends, and neighbours of the much-enduring family came to
      visit and comfort the damsel; but little or nothing might they profit her,
      for the poor girl was more and more attacked and oppressed by that
      disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a matron who had much studied that disease, and she turned and
      re-turned the suffering patient, this way, and that way, to her great pain
      and grief, God knows, and made a medicine of a hundred thousand sorts of
      herbs, but it was no good; the disease continued to get worse, so there
      was no help but to send for all the doctors of the city and round about,
      and for the poor girl to discover unto them her most piteous case.
    </p>
    <p>
      There came Master Peter, Master John, Master This, Master That&mdash;as
      many doctors as you would, who all wished to see the patient together, and
      uncover that portion of her body where this cursed disease, the piles had,
      alas, long time concealed itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl, as much cast down and grieved as though she were condemned
      to die, would in no wise agree or permit that her affliction should be
      known; and would rather have died than shown such a secret place to the
      eyes of any man.
    </p>
    <p>
      This obstinacy though endured not long, for her father and her mother came
      unto her, and remonstrated with her many times,&mdash;saying that she
      might be the cause of her own death, which was no small sin; and many
      other matters too long to relate here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, rather to obey her father and mother than from fear of death, the
      poor girl allowed herself to be bound and laid on a couch, head downwards,
      and her body so uncovered that the physicians might see clearly the seat
      of the disease which troubled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They gave orders what was to be done, and sent apothecaries with clysters,
      powders, ointments, and whatsoever else seemed good unto them; and she
      took all that they sent, in order that she might recover her health.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all was of no avail, for no remedy that the said physicians could
      apply helped to heal the distressing malady from which she suffered, nor
      could they find aught in their books, until at last the poor girl, what
      with grief and pain was more dead than alive, and this grief and great
      weakness lasted many days.
    </p>
    <p>
      And whilst the father and mother, relations, and neighbours sought for
      aught that might alleviate their daughter's sufferings, they met with an
      old Cordelier monk, who was blind of one eye, and who in his time had seen
      many things, and had dabbled much in medicine, therefore his presence was
      agreeable to the relations of the patient, and he having gazed at the
      diseased part at his leisure, boasted much that he could cure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may fancy that he was most willingly heard, and that all the
      grief-stricken assembly, from whose hearts all joy had been banished,
      hoped that the result would prove as he had promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he left, and promised that he would return the next day, provided and
      furnished with a drug of such virtue, that it would at once remove the
      great pain and martyrdom which tortured and annoyed the poor patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night seemed over-long, whilst waiting for the wished-for morrow;
      nevertheless, the long hours passed, and our worthy Cordelier kept his
      promise, and came to the patient at the hour appointed. You may guess that
      he was well and joyously received; and when the time came when he was to
      heal the patient, they placed her as before on a couch, with her backside
      covered with a fair white cloth of embroidered damask, having, where her
      malady was, a hole pierced in it through which the Cordelier might arrive
      at the said place.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at the seat of the disease, first from one side, then from the
      other: and anon he would touch it gently with his finger, or inspect the
      tube by which he meant to blow in the powder which was to heal her, or
      anon would step back and inspect the diseased parts, and it seemed as
      though he could never gaze enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he took the powder in his left hand, poured upon a small flat
      dish, and in the other hand the tube, which he filled with the said
      powder, and as he gazed most attentively and closely through the opening
      at the seat of the painful malady of the poor girl, she could not contain
      herself, seeing the strange manner in which the Cordelier gazed at her
      with his one eye, but a desire to burst out laughing came upon her, though
      she restrained herself as long as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it came to pass, alas! that the laugh thus held back was converted
      into a f&mdash;t, the wind of which caught the powder, so that the greater
      part of it was blown into the face and into the eye of the good Cordelier,
      who, feeling the pain, dropped quickly both plate and tube, and almost
      fell backwards, so much was he frightened. And when he came to himself, he
      quickly put his hand to his eye, complaining loudly, and saying that he
      was undone, and in danger to lose the only good eye he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he lie, for in a few days, the powder which was of a corrosive
      nature, destroyed and ate away his eye, so that he became, and remained,
      blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he caused himself to be led one day to the house where he had met
      with this sad mischance, and spoke to the master of the house, to whom he
      related his pitiful case, demanding, as was his right, that there should
      be granted to him such amends as his condition deserved, in order that he
      might live honourably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merchant replied that though the misadventure greatly vexed him, he
      was in nowise the cause of it, nor could he in any way be charged with it,
      but that he would, out of pity and charity, give him some money, and
      though the Cordelier had undertaken to cure his daughter and had not so
      done, would give him as much as he would if she had been restored to
      health, though not forced to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cordelier was not content with this offer, but required that he should
      be kept for the rest of his life, seeing that the merchant's daughter had
      blinded him, and that in the presence of many people, and thereby he was
      deprived from ever again performing Mass or any of the services of the
      Holy Church, or studying what learned men had written concerning the Holy
      Scriptures, and thus could no longer serve as a preacher; which would be
      his destruction, for he would be a beggar and without means, save alms,
      and these he could no longer obtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all that he could say was of no avail, and he could get no other
      answer than that given. So he cited the merchant before the Parliament of
      the said city of London, which called upon the aforesaid merchant to
      appear. When the day came, the Cordelier's case was stated by a lawyer
      well-advised as to what he should say, and God knows that many came to the
      Court to hear this strange trial, which much pleased the lords of the said
      Parliament, as much for the strangeness of the case as for the allegations
      and arguments of the parties debating therein, which were not only curious
      but amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To many folk was this strange and amusing case known, and was often
      adjourned and left undecided by the judges, as is their custom. And so
      she, who before this was renowned for her beauty, goodness, and
      gentleness, became notorious through this cursed disease of piles, but was
      in the end cured, as I have been since told.

    <h3>
      By Monseigneur de la Roche
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of the deceit practised by a knight on a miller's wife whom he made
        believe that her front was loose, and fastened it many times. And the
        miller informed of this, searched for a diamond that the knight's lady
        had lost, and found it in her body, as the knight knew afterwards: so he
        called the miller "fisherman", and the miller called him "fastener".</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the Duchy of Burgundy lived formerly a noble knight, whose name is not
      mentioned in the present story, who was married to a fair and gentle lady.
      And near the castle of the said knight lived a miller, also married to a
      fair young wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced once, that the knight, to pass the time and enjoy himself, was
      strolling around his castle, and by the banks of the river on which stood
      the house and mill of the said miller, who at that time was not at home,
      but at Dijon or Beaune,&mdash;he saw and remarked the wife of the said
      miller carrying two jars and returning from the river, whither she had
      been to draw water.
    </p>
    <p>
      He advanced towards her and saluted her politely, and she, being
      well-mannered, made him the salutation which belonged to his rank. The
      knight, finding that the miller's wife was very fair but had not much
      sense, drew near to her and said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of a truth, my friend, I see well that you are in ill case, and therefore
      in great peril."
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the miller's wife replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, monseigneur, and what shall I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, my dear, if you walk thus, your 'front piece' is in danger of
      falling off, and if I am not mistaken, you will not keep it much longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      The foolish woman, on hearing these words was astonished and vexed;&mdash;astonished
      to think how the knight could know, without seeing, of this unlucky
      accident, and vexed to think of the loss of the best part of her body, and
      one that she used well, and her husband also.
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied; "Alas! sir, what is this you tell me, and how do you know
      that my 'front piece' is in danger of falling off? It seems to keep its
      place well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there! my dear," replied the knight. "Let it suffice that I have
      told you the truth. You would not be the first to whom such a thing had
      happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, sir," said she. "I shall be an undone, dishonoured and lost woman;
      and what will my husband say when he hears of the mischance? He will have
      no more to do with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be not discomforted to that degree, my friend; it has not happened yet;
      besides there is a sure remedy."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young woman heard that there was a remedy for her complaint, her
      blood began to flow again, and she begged the knight for God's sake that
      he would teach her what she must do to keep this poor front-piece from
      falling off. The knight, who was always most courteous and gracious,
      especially towards the ladies, replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend, as you are a good and pretty girl, and I like your husband, I
      will teach you how to keep your front-piece."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, sir, I thank you; and certainly you will do a most meritorious
      work: for it would be better to die than to live without my front-piece.
      And what ought I to do sir?
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," he said, "to prevent your front-piece from falling off, you
      must have it fastened quickly and often."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fastened, sir? And who will do that? Whom shall I ask to do this for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you, my dear," replied the knight. "And because I warned you
      of this mischance being so near, and told you of the remedy necessary to
      obviate the inconveniences which would arise, and which I am sure would
      not please you,&mdash;I am content, in order to further increase the love
      between us, to fasten your front-piece, and put it in such a good
      condition that you may safely carry it anywhere, without any fear or doubt
      that it will ever fall off; for in this matter I am very skilful."
    </p>
    <p>
      It need not be asked whether the miller's wife was joyful. She employed
      all the little sense she had to thank the knight. So they walked together,
      she and the knight, back to the mill, where they were no sooner arrived
      than the knight kindly began his task, and with a tool that he had,
      shortly fastened, three or four times, the front-piece of the miller's
      wife, who was most pleased and joyous; and after having appointed a day
      when he might again work at this front-piece, the knight left, and
      returned quickly to his castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day named, he went again to the mill, and did his best, in the way
      above mentioned, to fasten this front-piece; and so well did he work as
      time went on, that this front-piece was most safely fastened, and held
      firmly and well in its place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst our knight thus fastened the front-piece of the miller's wife, the
      miller one day returned from his business, and made good cheer, as also
      did his wife. And as they were talking over their affairs, this most wise
      wife said to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my word, we are much indebted to the lord of this town."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me how, and in what manner," replied the miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite right that I should tell you, that you may thank him, as
      indeed you must. The truth is that, whilst you were away, my lord passed
      by our house one day that I was carrying two pitchers from the river. He
      saluted me and I did the same to him; and as I walked away, he saw, I know
      not how, that my front-piece was not held properly, and was in danger of
      falling off. He kindly told me so, at which I was as astonished and vexed
      as though the end of the world had come. The good lord who saw me thus
      lament, took pity on me, and showed me a good remedy for this cursed
      disaster. And he did still more, which he would not have done for every
      one, for the remedy of which he told me,&mdash;which was to fasten and
      hold back my front-piece in order to prevent it from dropping off,&mdash;he
      himself applied, which was great trouble to him, and he did it many times
      because that my case required frequent attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What more shall I say? He, has so well performed his work that we can
      never repay him. By my faith, he has in one day of this week fastened it
      three times; another day, four times; another day, twice; another day,
      three times; and he never left me till I was quite cured, and brought to
      such a condition that my front-piece now holds as well and firmly as that
      of any woman in our town."
    </p>
    <p>
      The miller, on hearing this adventure, gave no outward sign of what was
      passing in his mind, but, as though he had been joyful, said to his wife:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am very glad, my dear, that my lord hath done us this service, and, God
      willing, when it shall be possible, I will do as much for him. But at any
      rate, as it is not proper it should be known, take care that you say no
      word of this to anyone; and also, now that you are cured, you need not
      trouble my lord any further in this matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have warned me," replied his wife, "not to say a word about it and
      that is also what my lord bade me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our miller, who was a good fellow, often thought over the kindness that my
      lord had done him, and conducted himself so wisely and carefully that the
      said lord never suspected that he knew how he had been deceived, and
      imagined that he knew nothing. But alas, his heart and all his thoughts
      were bent on revenge and how he could repay in like manner the deceit
      practised on his wife. And at length he bethought himself of a way by
      which he could, he imagined, repay my lord in butter for his eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, owing to other circumstances, the knight was obliged to mount his
      horse and say farewell to his wife for a month; at which our miller was in
      no small degree pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, the lady had a desire to bathe, and caused the bath to be brought
      forth and the stoves to be heated in her private apartments; of which our
      miller knew soon, because he learned all that went on in the house; so he
      took a fine pike, that he kept in the ditch near his house, and went to
      the castle to present it to the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the waiting-women would he let take the fish, but said that he
      must present it himself to the lady, or else he would take it back home.
      At last, because he was well-known to the household, and a good fellow,
      the lady allowed him to enter whilst she was in her bath.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miller gave his present, for which the lady thanked him, and caused it
      to be taken to the kitchen and cooked for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he was talking, the miller perceived on the edge of the bath, a
      fine large diamond which she had taken from her finger, fearing lest the
      water should spoil it. He took it so quietly that no one saw him, and
      having gained his point, said good night to the lady and her women, and
      returned to the mill to think over his business.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, who was making good cheer with her attendants, seeing that it
      was now very late, and supper-time, left the bath and retired to her bed.
      And as she was looking at her arms and hands, she saw not the diamond, and
      she called her women, and asked them where was the diamond, and to whom
      she had given it. Each said, "It was not to me;"&mdash;"Nor to me,"&mdash;"Nor
      to me either."
    </p>
    <p>
      They searched inside and outside the bath, and everywhere, but it was no
      good, they could not find it. The search for this diamond lasted a long
      time, without their finding any trace of it, which caused the lady much
      vexation, because it had been unfortunately lost in her chamber, and also
      because my lord had given it to her the day of their betrothal, and she
      held it very precious. They did not know whom to suspect nor whom to ask,
      and much sorrow prevailed in the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one of the women bethought herself, and said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one entered the room but ourselves and the miller; it seems right that
      he should be sent for."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sent for, and came. The lady who was much vexed, asked the miller
      if he had not seen her diamond. He, being as ready to lie as another is to
      tell the truth, answered boldly, and asked if the lady took him for a
      thief? To which she replied gently;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not, miller; it would be no theft if you had for a joke taken
      away my diamond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame," said the miller, "I give you my word that I know nothing about
      your diamond."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then were they all much vexed, and my lady especially, so that she could
      not refrain from weeping tears in great abundance at the loss of this
      trinket. They all sorrowfully considered what was to be done. One said
      that it must be in the chamber, and another said that they had searched
      everywhere, and that it was impossible it should be there or they would
      have found it, as it was easily seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The miller asked the lady if she had it when she entered the bath; and she
      replied, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it be so, certainly, madam, considering the diligence you have made in
      searching for it, and without finding it, the affair is very strange.
      Nevertheless, it seems to me that if there is any man who could give
      advice how it should be found, I am he, and because I would not that my
      secret should be discovered and known to many people, it would be
      expedient that I should speak to you alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is easily managed," said the lady. So her attendants left, but, as
      they were leaving, Dames Jehanne, Isabeau, and Katherine said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, miller, you will be a clever man if you bring back this diamond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't say that I am over-clever," replied the miller, "but I venture to
      declare that if it is possible to find it I am the man to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he saw that he was alone with the lady, he told her that he believed
      seriously, that as she had the diamond when she entered the bath, that it
      must have fallen from her finger and entered her body, seeing that there
      was no one who could have stolen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that he might hasten to find it, he made the lady-get upon her bed,
      which she would have willingly refused if she could have done otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had uncovered her, he pretended to look here and there, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, madam, the diamond has entered your body."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you say, miller, that you have seen it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said she, "and how can it be got out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very easily, madam. I doubt not to succeed if it please you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May God help you! There is nothing that I would not do to get it again,"
      said the lady, "or to advance you, good miller."
    </p>
    <p>
      The miller placed the lady on the bed, much in the same position as the
      lord had placed <i>his</i> wife when he fastened her front-piece, and with
      a like tool was the search for the diamond made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst resting after the first and second search that the miller made for
      the diamond, the lady asked him if he had not felt it, and he said, yes,
      at which she was very joyful, and begged that he would seek until he had
      found it.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut matters short, the good miller did so well that he restored to the
      lady her beautiful diamond, which caused great joy throughout the house,
      and never did miller receive so much honour and advancement as the lady
      and her maids bestowed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good miller, who was high in the good graces of the lady after the
      much-desired conclusion of his great enterprise, left the house and went
      home, without boasting to his wife of his recent adventure, though he was
      more joyful over it than though he had gained the whole world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short time after, thank God, the knight returned to his castle, and was
      kindly received and humbly welcomed by the lady, who whilst they were
      enjoying themselves in bed, told him of the most wonderful adventure of
      the diamond, and how it was fished out of her body by the miller; and, to
      cut matters short, related the process, fashion, and manner employed by
      the said miller in his search for the diamond, which hardly gave her
      husband much joy, but he reflected that the miller had paid him back in
      his own coin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time he met the good miller, he saluted him coldly, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save you! God save you, good diamond-searcher!"
    </p>
    <p>
      To which the good miller replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save you! God save you, fastener of front-pieces!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By our Lady, you speak truly," said the knight. "Say nothing about me,
      and I will say nothing about you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The miller was satisfied, and never spoke of it again; nor did the knight
      either, so far as I know.

      STORY THE FOURTH &mdash; THE ARMED CUCKOLD. <a href="#linklinknote-4"

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>The fourth tale is of a Scotch archer who was in love with a fair and
        gentle dame, the wife of a mercer, who, by her husband's orders
        appointed a day for the said Scot to visit her, who came and treated her
        as he wished, the said mercer being hid by the side of the bed, where he
        could see and hear all.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      When the king was lately in the city of Tours, a Scottish gentleman, an
      archer of his bodyguard, was greatly enamoured of a beautiful and gentle
      damsel married to a mercer; and when he could find time and place, related
      to her his sad case, but received no favourable reply,&mdash;at which he
      was neither content nor joyous. Nevertheless, as he was much in love, he
      relaxed not the pursuit, but besought her so eagerly, that the damsel,
      wishing to drive him away for good and all, told him that she would inform
      her husband of the dishonourable and damnable proposals made to her,&mdash;which
      at length she did.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband,&mdash;a good and wise man, honourable and valiant, as you
      will see presently,&mdash;was very angry to think that the Scot would
      dishonour him and his fair wife. And that he might avenge himself without
      trouble, he commanded his wife that if the Scot should accost her again,
      she should appoint a meeting on a certain day, and, if he were so foolish
      as to come, he would buy his pleasure dearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good wife, to obey her husband's will, did as she was told. The poor
      amorous Scot, who spent his time in passing the house, soon saw the fair
      mercer, and when he had humbly saluted her, he besought her love so
      earnestly, and desired that she would listen to his final piteous prayer,
      and if she would, never should woman be more loyally served and obeyed if
      she would but grant his most humble and reasonable request.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair mercer, remembering the lesson that her husband had given her,
      finding the opportunity propitious, after many subterfuges and excuses,
      told the Scot that he could come to her chamber on the following evening,
      where he could talk to her more secretly, and she would give him what he
      desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may guess that she was greatly thanked, and her words listened to with
      pleasure and obeyed by her lover, who left his lady feeling more joyous
      than ever he had in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the husband returned home, he was told of all the words and deeds of
      the Scot, and how he was to come on the morrow to the lady's chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him come," said the husband. "Should he undertake such a mad business
      I will make him, before he leaves, see and confess the evil he has done,
      as an example to other daring and mad fools like him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening of the next day drew near,&mdash;much to the joy of the
      amorous Scot, who wished to see and enjoy the person of his lady;&mdash;and
      much also to the joy of the good mercer who was desiring a great vengeance
      to be taken on the person of the Scot who wished to replace him in the
      marriage bed; but not much to the taste of his fair wife, who expected
      that her obedience to her husband would lead to a serious fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      All prepared themselves; the mercer put on a big, old, heavy suit of
      armour, donned his helmet and gauntlets, and armed himself with a
      battle-axe. Like a true champion, he took up his post early, and as he had
      no tent in which to await his enemy, placed himself behind a curtain by
      the side of the bed, where he was so well-hidden that he could not be
      perceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lover, sick with desire, knowing the longed-for hour was now at hand,
      set out for the house of the mercer, but he did not forget to take his
      big, good, strong two-handed sword; and when he was within the house, the
      lady went up to her chamber without showing any fear, and he followed her
      quietly. And when he came within the room, he asked the lady if she were
      alone? To which she replied casually, and with some confusion, that she
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me the truth," said the Scot. "Is not your husband here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! let him come! By Saint Aignan, if he should come, I would split his
      skull to the teeth. By God! if there were three of them I should not fear
      them. I should soon master them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      After these wicked words, he drew his big, good sword, and brandished it
      three or four times; then laid it on the bed by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he kissed and cuddled her, and did much more at his leisure and
      convenience, without the poor coward by the side of the bed, who was
      greatly afraid he should be killed, daring to show himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Scot, after this adventure, took leave of the lady for a while, and
      thanked her as he ought for her great courtesy and kindness, and went his
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the valiant man of arms knew that the Scot was out of the
      house, he came out of his hiding place, so frightened that he could
      scarcely speak, and commenced to upbraid his wife for having let the
      archer do his pleasure on her. To which she replied that it was his fault,
      as he had made her appoint a meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not command you," he said, "to let him do his will and pleasure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could I refuse him," she replied, "seeing that he had his big sword,
      with which he could have killed me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At that moment the Scot returned, and came up the stairs to the chamber,
      and ran in and called out, "What is it?" Whereupon the good man, to save
      himself, hid under the bed for greater safety, being more frightened than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scot served the lady as he had done before, but kept his sword always
      near him. After many long love-games between the Scot and the lady, the
      hour came when he must leave, so he said good-night and went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor martyr who was under the bed would scarcely come out, so much did
      he fear the return of his adversary,&mdash;or rather, I should say, his
      companion. At last he took courage, and by the help of his wife was, thank
      God, set on his feet, and if he had scolded his wife before he was this
      time harder upon her than ever, for she had consented, in spite of his
      forbidding her, to dishonour him and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas," said she, "and where is the woman bold enough to oppose a man so
      hasty and violent as he was, when you yourself, armed and accoutred and so
      valiant,&mdash;and to whom he did more wrong than he did to me&mdash;did
      not dare to attack him, and defend me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is no answer," he replied. "Unless you had liked, he would never
      have attained his purpose. You are a bad and disloyal woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you," said she, "are a cowardly, wicked, and most blamable man; for I
      am dishonoured since, through obeying you, I gave a rendezvous to the
      Scot. Yet you have not the courage to undertake the defence of the wife
      who is the guardian of your honour. For know that I would rather have died
      than consent to this dishonour, and God knows what grief I feel, and shall
      always feel as long as I live, whilst he to whom I looked for help
      suffered me to be dishonoured in his presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      He believed that she would not have allowed the Scot to tumble her if she
      had not taken pleasure in it, but she maintained that she was forced and
      could not resist, but left the resistance to him and he did not fulfil his
      charge. Thus they both wrangled and quarrelled, with many arguments on
      both sides. But at any rate, the husband was cuckolded and deceived by the
      Scot in the manner you have heard.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Philippe De Laon.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>The fifth story relates two judgments of Lord Talbot. How a Frenchman
        was taken prisoner (though provided with a safe-conduct) by an
        Englishman, who said that buckle-straps were implements of war, and who
        was made to arm himself with buckle-straps and nothing else, and meet
        the Frenchman, who struck him with a sword in the presence of Talbot.
        The other, story is about a man who robbed a church, and who was made to
        swear that he would never enter a church again.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Lord Talbot (whom may God pardon) who was, as every one knows, so
      victorious as leader of the English, gave in his life two judgments which
      were worthy of being related and held in perpetual remembrance, and in
      order that the said judgments should be known, I will relate them briefly
      in this my first story, though it is the fifth amongst the others. I will
      tell it thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the time that the cursed and pestilent war prevailed between France
      and England, and which has not yet finished, (*) it happened, as was often
      the case, that a French soldier was taken prisoner by an Englishman, and,
      a ransom having been fixed, he was sent under a safe-conduct, signed by
      Lord Talbot, to his captain, that he might procure his ransom and bring it
      back to his captor.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was on his road, he was met by another Englishman, who, seeing he
      was a Frenchman, asked him whence he came and whither he was going? The
      other told him the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is your safe-conduct?" asked the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not far off," replied the Frenchman. With that he took the
      safe-conduct, which was in a little box hung at his belt, and handed it to
      the Englishman, who read it from one end to the other. And, as is
      customary, there was written on the safe-conduct, "Forbidden to carry any
      implements of warfare."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Englishman noted this, and saw that there were <i>esguillettes</i> on
      the Frenchman's doublet. (**) He imagined that these straps were real
      implements of war, so he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I make you my prisoner, because you have broken your safe-conduct."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my faith, I have not," replied the Frenchman, "saving your grace. You
      see in what condition I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! no!" said the Englishman. "By Saint John you have broken your
      safe-conduct. Surrender, or I will kill you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor Frenchman, who had only his page with him, and was quite
      unprovided with weapons, whilst the other was accompanied by three or four
      archers, did the best thing he could, and surrendered. The Englishman led
      him to a place near there, and put him in prison.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) It had virtually finished, and the English only retained
     the town of Calais when this tale was written (about 1465)
     but they had not relinquished their claim to the French
     Crown, and hostilities were expected to recommence.

     (**) <i>Esguillettes</i> were small straps or laces, used to
     fasten the cuirass to the doublet.
</pre>
    <p>
      The Frenchman, finding himself thus ill-treated, sent in great haste to
      his captain, who when he heard his man's case, was greatly and
      marvellously astonished. Thereupon he wrote a letter to Lord Talbot, and
      sent it by a herald, to ask how it was that one of his men had been
      arrested by one of Lord Talbot's men whilst under that general's
      safe-conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The said herald, being well instructed as to what he was to say and do,
      left his master, and presented the letters to Lord Talbot. He read them,
      and caused them to be read also by one of his secretaries before many
      knights and squires and others of his followers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he flew into a great rage, for he was hot-tempered and
      irritable, and brooked not to be disobeyed, and especially in matters of
      war; and to question his safe-conduct made him very angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      To shorten the story, he caused to be brought before him both the
      Frenchman and the Englishman, and told the Frenchman to tell his tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      He told how he had been taken prisoner by one of Lord Talbot's people, and
      put to ransom;
    </p>
    <p>
      "And under your safe-conduct, my lord, I was on my way to my friends to
      procure my ransom. I met this gentleman here, who is also one of your
      followers, who asked me whither I was going, and if I had a safe-conduct?
      I told him, yes, and showed it to him. And when he had read it he told me
      that I had broken it, and I replied that I had not, and that he could not
      prove it. But he would not listen to me, and I was forced, if I would not
      be killed on the spot, to surrender. I know of no cause why he should have
      detained me, and I ask justice of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Talbot, when he had heard the Frenchman, was not well content,
      nevertheless when the latter had finished, my Lord turned to the
      Englishman and asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you to reply to this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," said he, "it is quite true, as he has said, that I met him and
      would see his safe-conduct, which when I had read from end to end, I soon
      perceived that he had broken and violated; otherwise I should never have
      arrested him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How had he broken it?" asked Lord Talbot. "Tell me quickly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord, because in his safe-conduct he is forbidden all implements of
      war, and he had, and has still, real implements of war; that is to say he
      has on his doublet, buckle-straps, which are real implements of war, for
      without them a man cannot be armed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Lord Talbot, "and so buckle-straps are implements of war are
      they? Do you know of any other way in which he had broken his
      safe-conduct?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, my lord, I do not," replied the Englishman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, you villain!" said Lord Talbot. "Have you stopped a gentleman under
      my safe-conduct for his buckle-straps? By St. George, I will show you
      whether they are implements of war."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, hot with anger and indignation, he went up to the Frenchman, and
      tore from his doublet the two straps, and gave them to the Englishman;
      then he put a sword in the Frenchman's hand, and drawing his own good
      sword out of the sheath, said to the Englishman,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Defend yourself with that implement of war, as you call it, if you know
      how!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he said to the Frenchman,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Strike that villain who arrested you without cause or reason, and we
      shall see how he can defend himself with this implement of war. If you
      spare him, by St. George I will strike you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the Frenchman, whether he would or not, was obliged to strike at the
      Englishman with the sword, and the poor Englishman protected himself as
      best he could, and ran about the room, with Talbot after him, who made the
      Frenchman keep striking the other, and cried out;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Defend yourself, villain, with your implement of war!" In truth, the
      Englishman was so well beaten that he was nearly dead, and cried for mercy
      to Talbot and the Frenchman. The latter was released from his ransom by
      Lord Talbot, and his horse, harness, and all his baggage, were given back
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the first judgment of Lord Talbot; there remains to be given an
      account of the other, which was thus.
    </p>
    <p>
      He learned that one of his soldiers had robbed a church of the pyx in
      which is placed the Corpus Domini, and sold it for ready money&mdash;I
      know not for how much, but the pyx was big and fine, and beautifully
      enamelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Talbot, who though he was very brutal and wicked in war, had always
      great reverence for the Church, and would never allow a monastery or
      church to be set on fire or robbed, heard of this, and he was very severe
      on those who broke his regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he caused to be brought before him the man who had stolen the pyx from
      the church; and when he came, God knows what a greeting he had. Talbot
      would have killed him, if those around had not begged that his life might
      be saved. Nevertheless, as he would punish him, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rascal traitor! why have you dared to rob a church in spite of my
      orders?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my lord," said the poor thief, "for God's sake have mercy upon me; I
      will never do it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, villain," said Talbot; and the other came up about as
      willingly as though he were going to the gallows. And the said Lord Talbot
      rushed at him, and with his fist, which was both large and heavy, struck
      him on the head, and cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! you thief! have you robbed a church?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And the other cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mercy my lord! I will never do it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you do it again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my lord!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Swear then that you will never again enter a church of any kind. Swear,
      villain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good, my lord," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Talbot made the thief swear that he would never set foot in a church
      again, which made all who were present and who heard it, laugh, though
      they pitied the thief because Lord Talbot had forbidden him the church for
      ever, and made him swear never to enter it. Yet we may believe that he did
      it with a good motive and intention. Thus you have heard the two judgments
      of Lord Talbot, which were such as I have related to you.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>The sixth story is of a drunkard, who would confess to the Prior of
        the Augustines at the Hague, and after his confession said that he was
        then in a holy state and would die; and believed that his head was cut
        off and that he was dead, and was carried away by his companions who
        said they were going to bury him.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the city of The Hague in Holland, as the prior of the Augustine
      Monastery was one day saying his prayers on the lawn near the chapel of
      St. Antony, he was accosted by a great, big Dutchman who was exceedingly
      drunk, and who lived in a village called Schevingen, about two leagues
      from there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prior, who saw him coming from afar, guessed his condition by his
      heavy and uncertain step, and when they met, the drunkard saluted the
      prior, who returned the salute, and passed on reading his prayers,
      proposing neither to stop nor question him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The drunkard, being half beside himself, turned and pursued the prior, and
      demanded to be confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confession!" said the prior. "Go away! Go away! You have confessed
      already."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, sir," replied the drunkard, "for God's sake confess me. At present,
      I remember all my sins, and am most contrite."
    </p>
    <p>
      The prior, displeased to be interrupted by a drunkard, replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go your ways; you have no need of confession, for you are in a very
      comfortable case as it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no," said the drunkard, "as sure as death you shall confess me,
      master Curé, for I am most devout," and he seized him by the sleeve, and
      would have stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest would not listen to him, and made wonderful efforts to escape,
      but it was no good, for the other was obstinate in his desire to confess,
      which the priest would not hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The devotion of the drunkard increased more and more, and when he saw that
      the priest still refused to hear his sins, he put his hand on his big
      knife and drew it from its sheath, and told the priest he would kill him,
      if he did not listen to his confession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest, being afraid of a knife in such dangerous hands, did not know
      what to do, so he asked the other,
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is is you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish to confess," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well; I will hear you," said the priest. "Come here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our drunkard,&mdash;being more tipsy than a thrush in a vineyard,&mdash;began,
      so please you, his devout confession,&mdash;over which I pass, for the
      priest never revealed it, but you may guess it was both novel and curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest cut short the wearisome utterances of the drunkard, and gave
      him absolution, and, to get rid of him, said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go away now; you have made a good confession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say you so, sir?" he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, truly," said the priest, "it was a very good confession. Go, and sin
      no more!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, since I have well confessed and received absolution, if I were to
      die now, should I go to paradise?" asked the drunkard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Straight! Straight!" replied the priest. "There can be no doubt about
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since that is so," said the drunkard, "and I am now in a holy state, I
      would like to die at once, in order that I may go to heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he took and gave his knife to the priest, begging of him to cut
      off his head, in order that he might go to paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no!" said the priest, much astonished. "It is not my business to do
      that&mdash;you must go to heaven by some other means."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," replied the drunkard, "I wish to go there now, and to die here by
      your hands. Come, and kill me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not do that," said the prior. "A priest must not kill any one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall I swear; and if you do not at once despatch me and send me to
      heaven I will kill you with my own hands," and at these words he
      brandished his big knife before the eyes of the priest, who was terrified
      and alarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, having thought the matter over,&mdash;that he might get rid of
      this drunkard, who was becoming more and more aggressive, and perchance
      might have taken his life, he seized the knife, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well! since you wish to die by my hands in order that you may go to
      paradise,&mdash;kneel down before me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were hardly uttered before the drunkard fell flat, and with some
      trouble raised himself to his knees, and with his hands joined together,
      awaited the blow of the sword which was to kill him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest gave the drunkard a heavy blew with the back of the knife,
      which felled him to the ground, where he lay, and would not get up,
      believing himself to be in paradise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the priest left, not forgetting for his own safety to take the knife
      with him, and ere he had gone far he met a waggon full of people some of
      whom had been along with the drunkard that day, to whom he recounted all
      the story&mdash;begging that they would raise him and convey him home; he
      also gave them the knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      They promised to take charge of him, and the priest went away. They had
      hardly started on their way, when they perceived the good toper, lying as
      though dead, with his face to the ground; and when they were nigh to him,
      they all with one voice shouted his name,&mdash;but, shout as they would,
      he made no reply. Then they cried out again, but it was no use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then some of them descended from the waggon, and they took him by the
      head, and the feet, and the legs, and raised him from the ground, and so
      shook him that he opened his eyes and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave me alone! Leave me alone! I am dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, you are not," said his companions. "You must come along with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not," said the drunkard. "Where should I go? I am dead, and
      already in heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must come," said the others. "We will get some drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink?" said the other. "I shall never drink again; I am dead;" and for
      all that his comrades could say or do, they could not get it out of his
      head but that he was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dispute lasted long, and they could not persuade the drunkard to
      accompany them; for to all that they said he always replied, "I am dead".
    </p>
    <p>
      At last one of them bethought himself, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then since you are dead, you must not lie here and be buried like a beast
      of the field. Come! come along with us, and we will carry you in our
      waggon to the grave-yard of our town as befits a Christian. Otherwise you
      will not go to heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the drunkard heard that he must be buried in order that he might go
      to heaven, he was satisfied to obey, so he was soon tucked up in the
      waggon, where he was quickly asleep. The waggon was drawn by good cattle,
      and they were speedily at Schevingen, where the good drunkard was put down
      in front of his house. His wife and servants were called, and the body
      given to them, for he slept so soundly that he was carried from the waggon
      to the house and put in his bed without ever waking, and being laid
      between the sheets, at last woke up two days later.

    <h2>
      STORY THE SEVENTH &mdash; THE WAGGONER IN THE BEAR.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a goldsmith of Paris who made a waggoner sleep with him and his
        wife, and how the waggoner dallied with her from behind, which the
        goldsmith perceived and discovered, and of the words which he spake to
        the waggoner.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A goldsmith of Paris, once, in order to complete some of his wares in time
      for the fair of Lendit, laid in a large stock of willow charcoal. It
      happened one day amongst others, that the waggoner who delivered this
      charcoal, knowing that the goldsmith was in great haste, brought two
      waggons more than he had on any previous day, but hardly had he entered
      Paris with the last load than the city gates were shut on his heels.
      Nevertheless, he was well received by the goldsmith, and after the
      charcoal was unloaded, and the horses stabled, they all supped at their
      leisure, and made great cheer, and drank heavily. Just as the meal
      finished the clock struck midnight, which astonished them greatly, so
      quickly had the time passed at supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each one thanked God, and being heavy-eyed, only asked to go to bed, but
      as it was so late, the goldsmith detained the waggoner, fearing that he
      might meet the watch, who would have put him into the Châtelet had they
      found him at that hour of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time the goldsmith had many persons working for him, and he was
      obliged to make the waggoner lie with him and his wife, and, not being of
      a suspicions nature, he made his wife lie between him and the waggoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had great trouble to arrange this, for the good waggoner refused his
      hospitality, and would rather have slept in the barn or stable, but he was
      obliged to obey the goldsmith. And after he had undressed, he got into
      bed, in which already were the goldsmith and his wife, as I have already
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife feeling the waggoner approach her, moved nearer her husband, both
      on account of the cold and the smallness of the bed, and, instead of a
      pillow, placed her head upon her husband's breast, whilst her backside
      rested on the waggoner's knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goldsmith soon went to sleep, and his wife pretended to also, and the
      waggoner, being tired from his work, did the same. But as the stallion
      grows hot as soon as he approaches the mare, so did this stallion lift up
      his head on feeling so near to him the aforesaid woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not within the power of the waggoner to refrain from attacking her
      closely; and this lasted for some time without the woman waking, or at
      least pretending to wake. Nor would the husband have awaked, had it not
      been that the head of his wife reclined on his breast, and owing to the
      assault of this stallion, gave him such a bump that he quickly woke.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought at first that his wife was dreaming, but as her dream
      continued, and he heard the waggoner moving about and breathing hard, he
      gently put down his hand, and found what ravage the stallion of the
      waggoner was making in his warren;&mdash;at which, as he loved his wife,
      he was not well content. He soon made the waggoner with draw, and said to
      him,
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing, you wicked rascal? You must be mad to attack my wife
      in that way. Don't do it again! Morbleu! I declare to you that if she had
      woke just now when your machine was pushing her, I don't know what she
      would have done; but I feel certain, as I know her well, that she would
      have scratched your face, and torn out your eyes with her nails. You don't
      know what she will do when she loses her temper, and there is nothing in
      the world which puts her out more. Take it away, I beg, for your own
      sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      The waggoner, in a few words, declared that it was unintentional, and, as
      day was breaking, he rose and took his leave and went away with his cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may fancy that the good woman on whom the waggoner made this attempt
      was displeased in another way than her husband fancied; and afterwards it
      was said that the waggoner met her in the proper way: but I would not
      believe it or credit the report.

      STORY THE EIGHTH &mdash; TIT FOR TAT. <a href="#linklinknote-8"
      name="linklinknoteref-8" id="linklinknoteref-8">8</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur de la Roche
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a youth of Picardy who lived at Brussels, and made his master's
        daughter pregnant, and for that cause left and came back to Picardy to
        be married. And soon after his departure the girl's mother perceived the
        condition of her daughter, and the girl confessed in what state she was;
        so her mother sent her to the Picardian to tell him that he must undo
        that which he had done. And how his new bride refused then to sleep with
        him, and of the story she told him, whereupon he immediately left her
        and returned to his first love, and married her.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the city of Brussels, where a good many adventures have happened in our
      time, there lived not long ago a young man of Picardy, who served his
      master well and faithfully for a long period. And amongst other services
      which he did the said master was this; that by his civil speech, bearing,
      and courtesy he so gained the graces of his master's daughter, that he lay
      with her, and owing to his meritorious actions she became pregnant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth, knowing the lady was in that condition, was not such a fool as
      to wait until his master should perceive and know it. So he quickly asked
      leave to absent himself for a few days,&mdash;albeit he had no intention
      to return&mdash;pretending that he must go to Picardy to see his father
      and mother, and some others of his relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he took farewell of his master and mistress, and had a most piteous
      leave-taking with the daughter; to whom he promised quickly to return,&mdash;which
      he did not, and for good cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was in Picardy, at the house of his father, his master's daughter
      grew so big with child that her sad condition could no longer be
      concealed; amongst others, her worthy mother, who was experienced in such
      matters, was the first to notice it. She took her daughter on one side,
      and asked her how she came to be in that condition, and who was the cause
      of it. The girl had to be much pressed and scolded before she would say
      anything, but at last was forced to confess her sad condition, and own
      that it was the Picardian, who, a short while before, had been servant to
      her father, who had seduced her, and left her in that pitiful case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother was furious, and abused her till she could say no more, which
      the poor girl bore so patiently and without saying a word, that it was
      enough to excuse her for letting herself be put in the family-way by the
      Picardian.
    </p>
    <p>
      But alas! her patient endurance had no effect upon her mother, who said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go away! go away! disgraceful hussy! and do your best to find the man who
      made you pregnant, and tell him to undo that which he has done! Never come
      back to me till he has undone the wrong he has done you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl, who was in the condition you have heard, was crushed and
      overcome by the wrath of her cruel mother, and set out in search of the
      young man who had ruined her; and you may well imagine, had to endure much
      trouble and pain before she could hear any news of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at last, as God so willed it, after much wandering about through
      Picardy, she came, one Sunday, to a large village in the county of Artois,
      and she came most opportunely, for on that day her friend, the Picardian
      who had deceived her, was to be married, at which she was very joyful. And
      she cared so little about obeying her mother, that, big as she was, she
      pressed amongst the crowd, and when she saw her lover, she saluted him.
      He, when he saw her, blushed, and returned her salutation, and said to
      her;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are very welcome! What brings you here at this time, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My mother," she replied, "sent me to you, and God knows that you have
      caused me much upbraiding. She charged and commanded me that I should tell
      you that you must undo that which you have done, or, if you do not, I am
      never to go back to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other, when he heard this, to get rid of her as soon as he could,
      spoke as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I will willingly do that which you ask and your mother requires
      me to do, for it is very reasonable, but at this moment I cannot be seen
      talking to you. I beg of you to have patience for to-day, and to-morrow I
      will attend to your request."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that she was content, and then he caused her to be taken and put in a
      fair chamber, and commanded that she should be well-treated, as she
      deserved to be, after the great trouble and difficulty she had had in
      seeking him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that the bride had kept her eyes open, and when she saw
      her husband talking to a woman big with child, she had misgivings, and was
      by no means satisfied, but much troubled and vexed in mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nursed her wrath, and said nothing until her husband came to bed. And
      when he would have cuddled and kissed her, and done his proper duty as a
      husband, and so earned his "caudle", (*) she turned herself first on one
      side and then on the other, so that he could not attain his purpose, at
      which he was greatly astonished and angry, and said to her,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) It was the custom in the Middle Ages to bring in the
     middle of the wedding night, a caudle of hot milk, soup, or
     spiced wine to the married couple.
</pre>
    <p>
      "Why do you do that, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have good cause," she replied, "for I see from your acts that you do
      not care for me. There are many others you like better than me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my faith," said he, "there is no woman in the world I love better than
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" she said, "did I not see you after dinner holding discourse for a
      long time with a woman who was in the room! I saw you only too plainly,
      and you cannot excuse yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By our Lady," he replied, "you have no cause to be jealous about her,"
      and with that he told her that it was the daughter of his master at
      Brussels, and how he had lain with her and made her pregnant, and on that
      account he had left the place; and how also after his departure, she
      became so big with child that it was perceived, and then she had confessed
      to her mother who had seduced her, and her mother had sent her to him that
      he might undo that which he had done, or else she must never return home.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young man had finished his story, his wife who had been struck by
      one portion of it, said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Do you say that she told her mother you had slept with her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said; "she made it all known to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my word!" she replied, "then she proved herself very stupid. The
      waggoner at our house slept with me more than forty nights, but you don't
      suppose that I breathed a word of that to my mother. I took good care to
      say nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly," quoth he, "the devil takes care that the gibbet is not cheated.
      (**) Go back to your waggoner if you like; for I care nothing for you."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (**) In other words, we are punished for our ill-deeds.
</pre>
    <p>
      Thereupon he arose and went to the woman he had seduced, and left the
      other one; and when the morning came and this news was noised abroad, God
      knows that it amused many and displeased many others, especially the
      father and mother of the bride.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a knight of Burgundy, who was marvellously amorous of one of his
        wife's waiting women, and thinking to sleep with her, slept with his
        wife who was in the bed of the said tire-woman. And how he caused, by
        his order, another knight, his neighbour to sleep with the said woman,
        believing that it was really the tirewoman&mdash;and afterwards he was
        not well pleased, albeit that the lady knew nothing, and was not aware,
        I believe, that she had had to do with aught other than her own husband.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In order to properly continue these stories, the incidents of which happen
      in divers places and under various circumstances, there should not be
      omitted the tale of a gentle knight of Burgundy, who lived in a castle of
      his own that was fair and strong, and well provided with retainers and
      artillery, as his condition required.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fell in love with a fair damsel of his household, who was chief
      tire-woman to his wife, and his great affection for her took such hold
      upon him that he could not be happy without her, and was always conversing
      with her and beseeching her, and, in short, life seemed no good without
      her, so filled with love of her was he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, being chaste and prudent, wished to keep her honour, which she
      valued as she did her own soul, and would not betray the duty she owed to
      her mistress, and therefore she lent no ear to her master when he
      importuned her. And whenever he spoke to her, God knows what a rebuff he
      met, and how she remonstrated with him as to his boldness and ill-conduct.
      Moreover, she told him that if he continued she would inform her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, in spite of her threats, he would not abandon the enterprise, but
      pursued her more and more, so that at last the girl was forced to tell her
      mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady being informed of her lord's love affair, though she did not show
      it, was not well pleased; but she devised a plan, which was this.
    </p>
    <p>
      She charged the girl that the next time the knight solicited her, that she
      should lay aside all reserve, and inform him that on the following night
      she would expect him in her chamber and in her bed; "And if he should
      accept the rendezvous," added the lady; "I will take your place; and leave
      the rest to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was pleased to obey her mistress, as was her duty, and promised
      she would do as she was bid.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before my lord again returned to the charge, and prayed
      her more warmly than before, saying that if she did not grant his prayer,
      he would rather die than live longer in this hopeless passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      What need is there of a long story? The girl, being thoroughly
      well-instructed by her mistress, appointed an hour at which he should come
      to her the next night, at which he was so well-pleased that his heart
      leapt for joy, and he promised himself that he would not fail to be there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desired day arrived, but in the evening, a gentle knight, a neighbour
      of my lord and his great friend, came to see him, for whom my lord made,
      as he well knew how, great cheer; as did my lady also, and the rest of the
      household were not behind-hand, knowing that to be the good pleasure of my
      lord and my lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      After much feasting and a supper and a banquet, it was time to retire to
      rest, and having said good-night to the lady and her women, the two
      knights began to talk over various matters, and, amongst other things, the
      visitor asked my lord if there were any pretty women with shoulder-knots
      in the village, (*) for the weather being fine, and having made good
      cheer, he had a desire for a woman.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) In some towns of the south of France, in the Middle
     Ages, the courtesans used to wear a knot of coloured ribbon
     on the shoulder.
</pre>
    <p>
      My lord, on account of the great love he bore his friend, would hide
      nothing from him, and told him how he had that night agreed to sleep with
      the tire-woman; and that he might do his friend pleasure, when he had been
      with her a certain time, he would, he said, rise gently, and go away, and
      let the visitor do the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor thanked his host, and God knows that the hour seemed long in
      coming. At last the host took leave of his guest, and went to his room, as
      was his custom, to undress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that whilst the knights were talking, my lady went to
      the bed in which my lord expected to find the tiring-maid, and there she
      awaited whatever God might be pleased to send her.
    </p>
    <p>
      My lord was a long time undressing, to give time to his wife to go to
      sleep. He then dismissed his valet, and in his long dressing-gown went to
      where his lady awaited him,&mdash;he thinking to find some-one else,&mdash;and
      silently undressed and got into bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as the candle was put out, and the lady uttered no word, he believed
      he was with the woman. Hardly had he got into bed before he began to
      perform his duty, and so well did he acquit himself, that three, even
      four, times did not content him; whereat his wife felt great pleasure, and
      thinking that that was all, fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      My lord, now much lighter than when he came, seeing that the lady slept,
      and remembering his promise, rose quietly and went to his friend, who was
      awaiting orders to go into action, and told him to take his place, but
      that he must not speak a word, and must come away when he had done all
      that he wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other, as wide-awake as a rat, and straining at the leash like a
      greyhound,&mdash;went, and lay down by the lady without her knowing of it.
      And though he felt assured that my lord had already worked well, and he
      was in haste, he did better, at which my lady was in no small degree
      astonished, and after this amusement&mdash;which was not distasteful to
      her&mdash;she again fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the good knight left her, and returned to my lord, who again resumed
      his place by my lady's side as before, and made a fresh attack upon her&mdash;so
      well did the exercise please him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the hours passed,&mdash;either in sleeping or doing something else,&mdash;until
      day broke; and as he turned round in bed, expecting to behold the
      tire-woman, he saw and knew that it was his wife, who thereupon said to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you not a recreant, cowardly, and wicked whoremonger? You thought to
      have had my tire-woman, and it is upon me that you have so many times
      essayed your unbridled and measureless lust. Thank God you have been
      deceived, for no one else shall ever have that which belongs to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good knight was both astonished and angry, and no wonder. And when he
      spoke at last, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I cannot hide from you my folly, and I greatly grieve ever to
      have undertaken such an enterprise. I beg of you to be satisfied with what
      you have done, and never mention it for never in all my life shall it
      occur again. That I promise you on my honour; and that you may never have
      occasion to be reminded of it, I will send away the woman who has played
      this trick upon me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, who was more satisfied with this adventure than her woman, and
      seeing how contrite her husband was, allowed herself to be gained-over,
      but not without making some remonstrances and scoldings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, all was arranged satisfactorily, but the knight, who had a
      flea in his ear, as soon as he rose, went to his companion, to whom he
      related the adventure at full length, and demanded from him two promises;
      the first was that he should strictly promise to say nothing of the
      matter, and the second that he should never meet his wife again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other, who was much vexed at this unfortunate affair, comforted the
      knight as best he could, and promised to perform his very reasonable
      requests; then mounted his horse and rode off. The tire-woman, who was not
      to blame for the <i>contretemps</i>, bore the punishment however, and was
      sent away. The knight and the lady lived long together without her ever
      being aware that she had had to do with a strange knight.

      STORY THE TENTH &mdash; THE EEL PASTIES. <a href="#linklinknote-10"
      name="linklinknoteref-10" id="linklinknoteref-10">10</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur de la Roche
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a knight of England, who, after he was married, wished his mignon
        to procure him some pretty girls, as he did before; which the mignon
        would not do, saying that one wife sufficed; but the said knight brought
        him back to obedience by causing eel pasties to be always served to him,
        both at dinner and at supper.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Many wonderful and curious adventures have occurred in England, though
      their recital would be out of place amongst these tales. Nevertheless, the
      present story is appropriate to be told here to increase the number of
      these tales, and is of a great lord of the kingdom of England, who was
      very rich and powerful, and who, amongst all his servitors, had especial
      trust, confidence, and affection in a young gentleman of his household,
      and that for various reasons. And because of his loyalty, diligence,
      cunning, and prudence, and other good qualities he found in him, he hid
      from him nothing concerning his love-affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time went on, the said young gentleman, by his cleverness, grew so much
      in his master's favour, that he not only knew his master's love-affairs,
      but acted as emissary and go-between on every occasion, as long as his
      master was unmarried.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a certain time after that, it happened that by the advice of his
      relatives, friends, and well-wishers, my lord was married to a beautiful,
      noble, good, and rich lady, much to the joy of many persons; and amongst
      other our <i>mignon</i> was not the least joyful, as he said to himself
      that the marriage would be to his master's welfare and honour, and would
      cause him he hoped to cease from those pleasures of love which he had
      hitherto practised.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he told the lord how glad he was that he had married a fair and
      good lady, for now he would not need to have women sought for him as
      before. To which my lord replied that nevertheless he did not intend to
      abandon all his love-affairs, and although he was married would sometimes
      employ the young man's services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youth was not pleased to hear this, and replied that such amours
      should cease now that his love was shared by a lady who excelled all
      others in beauty, prudence, and goodness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do as you please, my lord," said he, "but, for my part, I will never
      carry a message to any woman if it is to prejudice my mistress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know not what you mean by prejudice," said his master, "but you must
      prepare to go to such and such ladies. For I would have you know that your
      duties will be as they were before."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my lord," said the youth, "it seems that you take a pleasure in
      abusing women, which is not right; for you know well that all those you
      have named are not to be compared in beauty or other respects to my lady,
      to whom you are offering a deadly insult if she should ever hear of your
      misconduct. And what is more, you cannot be ignorant that in so doing you
      damn your own soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cease your preaching," said my lord, "and do as I command."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me, my lord," said the youth. "I would rather die than, through my
      means, trouble should arise between you and my lady; and I beg of you to
      be satisfied with me as I am, for certainly I will no more act as I once
      used."
    </p>
    <p>
      My lord, who saw how obstinate the young man was, pressed him no more at
      that time. But three or four days after that, without alluding to the
      conversation they had had, he demanded of the young man, amongst other
      things, what dish he preferred, and he replied that no dish pleased him so
      much as eel pasties.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John, it is a good dish," said his master; "you have not chosen
      badly."
    </p>
    <p>
      That being said, my lord retired, and caused to be sent to him his
      major-domo, whom he charged by his obedience that he should serve to the
      young man nothing but eel pasties, whatsoever he might say or do; and the
      major-domo promised to perform his commands, which he did, for on the same
      day, as the said youth was seated at table in his chamber, his servant
      brought unto him many fair and large eel pasties which had been delivered
      to him from the kitchen,&mdash;at which he was pleased, and ate his fill.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow it was the same, and the five or six following days he was
      brought like pasties, of which he was already weary. So the youth asked of
      his servants why they brought him nothing but these pasties?
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my faith, sir," they replied, "they will give us nothing else. We see
      very well that they send to the hall and elsewhere, other meats; but for
      you there is nothing but pasties."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, being wise and prudent, and caring little for his stomach,
      made no complaint, and several days passed; during which he was still
      served with these everlasting pies, at which he was not best pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he determined to go and dine with the stewards, where he was
      served as before with eel pasties. And when he saw that, he could not help
      asking why they served him differently to the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God's death!" quoth he, "I am so stuffed that I can eat no more. It seems
      to me that I see nothing but eel pies. Let me tell you there is no sense
      in it,&mdash;you carry the joke too far. For more than a month you have
      played this trick upon me. I am so worn-out that I have neither health nor
      strength. I do not like to be treated in this manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stewards told him that they only did as their master had bidden them,
      and that it was not their own doing. The young man, wearied of these pies,
      determined to complain to my lord, and ask him why he had caused the eel
      pies to be always served, and forbidden the cooks to supply any other
      dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply, my lord said unto him, "Did you not tell me that eel pie was the
      dish that you most liked in all the world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John, yes, my lord," said the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why do you complain now," said my lord, "since I cause you to be
      served with that which you like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like them," replied the young man, "in moderation. I like exceedingly
      to have eel pies once, or twice, or three times, or now and then, and
      there is no dish I love better. But to eat it always, and nothing else
      beside,&mdash;by Our Lady I will not. Any man would be sick and weary. My
      stomach is so sick of eel pasties, that the moment I smell them I have
      already dined. For God's sake, my lord, command that I be given some other
      food that I may recover my appetite; otherwise I am a dead man." "Ah!"
      said my lord, "Yet it seems that you do not think I shall be a dead man if
      I content myself with the charms of my wife. By my soul, you may believe
      that I am as weary of them as you are of the pasties, and would as
      willingly have a change,&mdash;though there is none I love so much&mdash;as
      you desire another dish, though you like pasties best. In short, you shall
      eat no other food until you consent to serve me as you did before, and
      bring me a variety of women,&mdash;even as you would have a variety of
      dishes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, when he heard this subtle comparison, was confused, and
      promised his master that he would do all that was desired, if he could but
      be quit of his pasties, and would carry messages and conduct intrigues as
      before. And from that time forth my lord, to spare my lady, and by the
      good help of his <i>mignon</i>, passed his time with fair and honest
      damsels, and the young man was relieved of his eel pasties, and restored
      to his old office.

    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a jealous rogue, who after many offerings made to divers saints to
        curé him of his jealousy, offered a candle to the devil who is usually
        painted under the feet of St. Michael; and of the dream that he had and
        what happened to him when he awoke.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A cowardly, jealous old hunks (I will not say that he was a cuckold) knew
      not to whom to have recourse to be cured of his jealous grief and misery.
      To-day he would make one pilgrimage, and to-morrow another, and often
      would send his servants to perform his devotions and make offerings whilst
      he was seated in his house to look after his wife, who passed her time
      miserably with the most cursed husband and suspicious grumbler that ever
      woman married.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, as he thought of the many offerings that he had made or was to
      make to the various saints in heaven and amongst others to St. Michael, he
      bethought him that he would make one to the figure that is under the feet
      of the said St. Michael.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he commanded one of his servants to light and bring a large wax
      candle, and offer it on his behalf. Soon it was reported to him that his
      orders had been obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thus," said he to himself, "I shall see if God or the devil can cure me,"
      and in his usual ill-temper he went to bed with his good and honest wife,
      and perhaps because he had so many fancies and whims in his head that
      nature was restrained, she lay in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact he slept soundly, and when he was in the depth of his sleep, he to
      whom the candle had that day been offered, appeared unto him in a vision,
      and thanked him for his offering, declaring that such a sacrifice had
      never before been made to him. Moreover, he told the man that he had not
      lost his labour, and should obtain his request, and whilst the other lay
      still in deep sleep, it seemed to him that a ring was placed on his
      finger, and he was told that whilst that ring was on his finger he should
      never be jealous or have any cause for jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the vision had vanished, our jealous hunks awoke, and expected to
      find on his finger the said ring, and found that one of his fingers was in
      the backside of his wife, at which both he and she were much astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of the rest of the life of this jealous fool, and of his business and
      condition, this story is silent.

      STORY THE TWELFTH &mdash; THE CALF. <a href="#linklinknote-12"
      name="linklinknoteref-12" id="linklinknoteref-12">12</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur de la Roche
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a Dutchman, who at all hours of the day and night ceased not to
        dally with his wife in love sports; and how it chanced that he laid her
        down, as they went through a wood, under a great tree in which was a
        labourer who had lost his calf. And as he was enumerating the charms of
        his wife, and naming all the pretty things he could see, the labourer
        asked him if he could not see the calf he sought, to which the Dutchman
        replied that he thought he could see a tail.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the borders of Holland there formerly lived a foolish fellow, who
      determined to do the worst thing he could&mdash;that is, get married. And
      so entranced was he with the joys of wedlock, that although it was winter,
      he was so heated that the night&mdash;which at that season was nine or ten
      hours&mdash;was not sufficiently long to enable him to appease the ardent
      desires which he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wherever he met his wife he put her on her back; whether it was in the
      chamber, or in the stable, or any other place, he always attacked her. And
      this did not last only one or two months, but longer than I care to tell,
      for it would not be convenient that many women should hear of the zeal of
      this insatiable worker. What more shall I say? He performed so often that
      his memory has never been forgotten, or will be, in that country. And in
      truth the woman who formerly complained to the Bailli of Amiens had not
      such good cause as this man's wife, but, notwithstanding that she could
      often have dispensed with this pleasant task she was always obedient to
      her husband, and never restive under the spur.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced one day, after dinner, when the weather was very fine, and the
      sun shot its rays over the flower-embroidered earth, that the fancy came
      to this man and his wife that they two would go alone to the woods, and
      they started on their road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, in order that you may learn my story, let me tell you that exactly at
      the same time as these good folk went forth to play in the wood, it
      chanced that a labourer had lost his calf, which he had put to graze in a
      field at the edge of the wood; but when he came to search for his calf he
      could not find it, at which he was sad at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he set out to search for the said calf both in the wood and in the
      fields, and the places round about, to gather news of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bethought him that perchance it might have wandered into some thicket
      to graze, or to some grassy ditch which it would not leave till it had
      filled its belly; and to the end that he might the better see, without
      running hither and thither, whether his surmise was right, he chose the
      highest and thickest tree that he could find, and climbed into it, and
      when he had climbed to the top of his tree, from whence he could see all
      the adjacent fields and wood, he was sure that he was half-way towards
      finding his calf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the honest fellow was casting his eyes on all sides to find his
      calf, there came through the wood our man and his wife, singing, playing,
      and rejoicing, as light hearts will do in a pleasant place. Nor was it
      wonderful that the desire came to him to tumble his wife in such a
      pleasant and suitable place, and looking now to the right now to the left
      for a spot where he might conveniently take his pleasure, he saw the big
      tree in which was the labourer&mdash;though he knew it not&mdash;and under
      that tree he prepared to accomplish his pleasant purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he came to that place, his desires soon inflamed him, and he
      waited not to begin his work, but attacked his wife and threw her on the
      ground, for at that time he was very merry and his wife also.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would fain see her both before and behind, and for that reason took off
      her dress, so that she was only in her petticoat, and that he pulled up
      very high in spite of her efforts, and that he might the better see at his
      ease her beauties, he turned her this way and that, and three or four
      times did his strong hand fall upon her big buttocks. Then he turned her
      on the other side, and as he had regarded her backside, so did he her
      front, to which the good, honest woman would in no wise consent, and
      besides the resistance that she made, her tongue was not idle.
    </p>
    <p>
      She called him "ungracious", "a fool", "a madman", "disgusting", and many
      other things, but it was no good; he was stronger than she was, and would
      make an inventory of all her charms, and she was forced to let him,&mdash;preferring,
      like a wise woman, to please her husband, than to annoy him by a refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having broken down all her defences, this valiant man feasted his eyes on
      her front part, and, shame to say, was not content until his hands had
      revealed to his eyes all the secrets for which he searched.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he was profoundly studying her body, he would say, "I see this! I
      see that! Now again this! Now again that!" until whosoever heard him would
      have thought he saw all the world and much beside. And, finally, after a
      long and thorough examination, he cried, "Holy Mary! what a lot of things
      I see!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, good people," then said the labourer in the tree; "you do not
      happen to see my calf? It seems to me, sir, that I can see its tail."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other was much vexed and astonished, and replied quickly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "That tail is not the tail of your calf," and with that he walked away,
      and his wife after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it should be asked what moved the labourer to put that question, the
      writer of this story would reply that the hair in front of this woman was
      very long and thick, as is usual with the Dutch women, and he might well
      have thought it was the tail of his calf, and as also her husband was
      saying that he could see so many things&mdash;nearly everything there was
      in the world&mdash;the labourer thought to himself that the calf could
      hardly be far off, but might be hidden inside along with the other things.

      STORY THE THIRTEENTH &mdash; THE CASTRATED CLERK. <a
      href="#linklinknote-13" name="linklinknoteref-13" id="linklinknoteref-13">13</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur L'amant De Brucelles.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>How a lawyer's clerk in England deceived his master making him
        believe that he had no testicles, by which reason he had charge over his
        mistress both in the country and in the town, and enjoyed his pleasure.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      At London, in England, there formerly lived a lawyer, who, amongst his
      other servitors, had a clerk who was clever, and diligent, wrote well, and
      was a handsome lad, and was, moreover, let it be stated, as cunning as any
      man of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentle and lusty clerk was much smitten with his mistress,&mdash;a
      beautiful, kind, and gentle dame&mdash;who so much admired him that if
      ever he had but dared to reveal his affection, the god of love would have
      led her to confess that he was the only man on earth who pleased her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced that once, being in a suitable place, and all fear being laid
      aside, he recounted unto the said lady his sad, but not unpleasant, case;
      and she by the great courtesy which God had not forgotten to give her,
      being already touched as has before been said, did not long delay; for
      after she had addressed to him many excuses and remonstrances, she was
      glad to let him know that he pleased her well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other,&mdash;who was no fool&mdash;was more joyed than he had ever
      been, and determined to hammer the iron while it was hot, and so warmly
      pursued her, that ere long he enjoyed her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      The love of the mistress for the clerk, and of the clerk for the mistress,
      was for a long time so ardent, that never were people more taken with each
      other; for not seldom did they forget to eat and drink, and it would not
      have been in the power of Malbouche or Dangier (*) nor other such cursed
      sprites, to have disturbed their happiness.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) Allegorical personages, typifying slander and jealousy,
     mentioned in the Romaunt de la Rose.
</pre>
    <p>
      In this joyous state and pleasant pastime, they passed many days such as
      are rarely given to lovers, and so fond were they of each other, that they
      would almost have renounced their share of paradise, to live in the world
      in that condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced one day they were together, talking of the great affection they
      bore each other, and devising how they could safely continue to take their
      pleasure without some inkling of their dangerous pastime being known to
      her husband, who was as jealous as a man could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may fancy that more than one idea occurred to them, which I here pass
      over, but the final conclusion and supreme resolution of the good clerk,
      was to vow to act carefully and bring his undertaking to a lucky
      termination,&mdash;in which he failed not, and this is how he accomplished
      his end.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must know that while the clerk was on intimate and friendly terms with
      his mistress, and diligently served and pleased her, he was at the same
      time not less diligent to serve and please his master, that he might the
      better conceal his own faults and blind the eyes of the jealous husband,
      who little suspected what was being prepared for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day soon after, our clerk, seeing that his master was well satisfied
      with him, spoke to him when he was alone, most humbly, softly, and with
      great respect, and told him that he had a great secret which he would
      willingly reveal if he dared.
    </p>
    <p>
      And, it must be told, that like women, who have tears at their command and
      can shed them whenever they like, our clerk, whilst he spoke, let fall
      from his eyes tears in great abundance,&mdash;which any man would have
      taken to be signs of sorrow, pity, and honest purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the poor abused master heard his clerk, he was much astonished, and
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter, my son, and why do you weep?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, sir, I have much more cause than anyone else to be sorrowful, but
      my case is so strange, and not the less pitiful, that it should be hidden;
      nevertheless I have determined to tell you, if I can lay aside the fear
      which for long has haunted me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not weep, my son," replied his master, "and tell me what it is, and I
      assure you that if it is possible for me to aid, you I will willingly give
      you all the assistance I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Master," said the cunning clerk, "I thank you; but I have thought the
      matter over, and I do not think my tongue will be able to relate the great
      misfortune that I have long time borne."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave all your grief and pratings," replied the master. "Nothing ought to
      be hidden from me, as your master, and I wish to know what is the matter;
      therefore come here and tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk, who knew the length of his master's foot, had to be much
      entreated, and pretended to be in great fear, and shed great abundance of
      tears before he would accede and say what he had to say, and then made his
      master promise that he would reveal the secret to no man, for he would
      rather die than have his misfortune known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master having given this promise, the clerk&mdash;pale, and trembling
      like a man who was going to be hanged&mdash;told his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My most worthy master, I know that all people, and you amongst them,
      imagine that I am a natural man like any other, capable of having
      connexion with a woman, and creating children; but I affirm and can prove
      that I am not such&mdash;to my great sorrow, alas."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with these words he pulled out his member and showed his bag. He had
      with much time and trouble pushed up his testicles towards his lower
      belly, and so well concealed them that it seemed as though he had none.
      Then he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Master, you now know my misfortune, which I again beg of you not to let
      be known, and, moreover, I humbly beg of you by all the services I have
      ever rendered,&mdash;which would have been greater if my power had
      equalled my will&mdash;that you will allow me to pass the rest of my life
      in some holy monastery, where I may spend my time in the service of God,
      for I am of no use in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      His worthy and much-abused master discoursed unto him of the austerities
      of a religious life, and how little merit there was in becoming a monk out
      of grief for a misfortune, and by many other means, too numerous to
      recount here, prevailed on him to renounce his intention. And you must
      know, moreover, that he would on no account lose his clerk, on account of
      his skill in writing, and diligence, and the use he intended to make of
      him. What need to say more? He so remonstrated that the clerk, in short,
      promised to remain for a further time in his service. And as the clerk had
      revealed his secret, so also did the master lay bare his own heart, and
      said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son, I am not glad to hear of your misfortune; but in the end God
      orders all things for the best, and knows what is most suitable for us.
      You can in future serve me well, and merit all that is in my power to do
      for you. I have a young wife, who is light-hearted and flighty, and I am
      old and staid; which might give occasion to some to dishonour me and her
      also, if she should prove other than chaste, and afford me matter for
      jealousy, and many other things. I entrust her to you that you may watch
      over her, and I beg of you to guard her so that I may have no reason to be
      jealous."
    </p>
    <p>
      After long deliberation, the clerk gave his reply, and when he spoke, God
      knows how he praised his most fair and kind mistress, saying that she
      excelled all others in beauty and goodness, of that he was sure.
      Nevertheless, that service or any other he would perform with all his
      heart, and never leave her whatever might happen, but inform his master of
      all that occurred, as a good servant should.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master, pleased and joyful at the new guardian he had found for his
      wife, left the house, and went to the town to do his business. And the
      good clerk at once entered upon his duties, and, as much as they dared,
      employed the members with which they were provided, and made great cheer
      over the subtle manner in which the husband had been deceived. For a long
      period did they continue thus to enjoy themselves; and if at any time the
      good husband was forced to go abroad, he took care to leave his clerk
      behind; rather would he borrow a servant from one of his neighbours than
      not leave the clerk to mind house. And if the lady had leave to go on any
      pilgrimage, she would rather go without her tire-woman than without the
      kind and obliging clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, as you may suppose, never could clerk boast of a more lucky
      adventure, and which&mdash;so far as I know&mdash;never came to the
      knowledge of the husband, who would have been overcome with grief had he
      learned of the trick.

        Pope; and how, when she brought forth it was a girl, and thus was the

    <p>
      The borders of Burgundy furnish many adventures worthy to be written and
      remembered, and have provided the present story, not to speak of many
      others which could be related. I will here only speak of an adventure
      which happened formerly in a big village on the river Ousche.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was, and is still, a mountain near, on which a hermit&mdash;of God
      knows what sort&mdash;made his residence, and who under the cloak of
      hypocrisy did many strange things, which did not come to the knowledge of
      the common people until the time when God would no longer suffer his most
      damnable abuses to continue.
    </p>
    <p>
      This holy hermit was during all his life as lewd and mischievous as an old
      ape, but surpassed all ordinary mortals in cunning. And this is what he
      did.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought amongst all the women and pretty girls the one most worthy to be
      loved and desired, and resolved that it was the daughter of a poor, simple
      woman,&mdash;a widow who was very devout and charitable&mdash;and made up
      his mind that, if he could have his way, she should become his prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, about midnight, when the weather was very rough and stormy, he
      descended from the mountain and came to the village, and passing by
      bye-roads and footpaths, came to where the mother and daughter lived,
      without being seen or heard. He knew the house, which was not large, and
      to which he had often been for devotional purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bored a hole in a part of the wall not exposed, and near the spot where
      stood the bed of the simple widow woman, and passing a long, hollow stick,
      with which he was provided, and without awaking the widow, placed it near
      her ear, and said in a low voiced three times,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear my voice, woman of God. I am an angel of the Creator, and have been
      sent to you to announce that for your many good deeds which you have
      performed there shall issue from your seed, that is your daughter, one who
      shall unite, reform, and restore his bride the Church. And it shall be in
      this manner. Thou shalt go to the mountain, to the holy hermit, and take
      thy daughter, and relate to him at length that which God now commands you
      by me. He shall know thy daughter, and from them shall spring a son, the
      elect of God, and destined to fill the Holy Seat of Rome, who shall do
      such good deeds that he may fitly be compared to St. Peter and St. Paul.
      Hearken to my voice! Obey God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The foolish widow, much astonished and surprised, and half ravished with
      delight, really believed that God had sent this messenger. She vowed to
      herself that she would not disobey, and it was long ere she slept again,
      and then not very soundly, so greatly did she desire and await the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the good hermit returned to his hermitage in the mountain. The
      much-desired day at last dawned, and the sun pierced into the chamber of
      the said widow, and both mother and daughter rose in great haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were up and dressed, and their little household set in order,
      the mother asked her daughter if she had heard anything in the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daughter replied, "No, mother; nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not to you," said the mother, "that the message was first
      delivered, albeit it concerns you greatly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she related at length the angel's message which God had sent her, and
      asked her what she should reply thereto?
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, who was like her mother, simple and devout, replied; "Praise be
      to God. Whatever pleases you, mother, shall be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is well spoken," replied the mother. "Let us go to the mountain to
      the holy man, as the angel bade us."
    </p>
    <p>
      The hermit was on the watch to see whether the foolish woman would bring
      her innocent daughter, and beheld them coming. He left his door half open,
      and knelt down in prayer in his chamber, in order that he might be found
      at his devotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened as he wished, for the good woman and her daughter, when they
      saw the door open, entered at once; and when they beheld the hermit in
      holy contemplation, as though he had been a god, they did homage to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hermit, with his eyes bent down to the earth, said in a humble voice;
      "God save you both."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the poor, old woman, anxious that he should know the cause of her
      coming, took him on one side, and told him from beginning to end the story&mdash;which
      he knew better than she did. And as she related the tale with great
      veneration and respect, the hermit folded his hands and turned up his eyes
      to heaven, and the good old woman wept, more for joy than for grief; and
      the poor girl also wept when she saw this good and holy hermit pray with
      such deep devotion she did not know why.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the story was finished, the old woman awaited the reply, which he did
      not hasten to give. But after a certain time he spoke, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Praise be to God! But, my dear friend, are you really sure that the
      message you say you heard, may not have been some fancy or illusion
      created by your own heart? The matter is a serious one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I certainly heard the voice, father, which brought me this joyful
      message, as plainly as I now hear you, and I do not think I was asleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said he, "I should be unwilling to act against the wishes of my
      Creator; but it seems best to me that you and I should again sleep upon
      this matter, and if the angel should appear to you again, come back and
      tell me, and God will give us good counsel. We should not believe too
      readily, good mother. The devil, who is always envious of the good, has
      many tricks, and can change himself into an angel of light. Believe me,
      mother, it is no light thing you ask of me, and it is no marvel if I seem
      to hesitate. Have I not sworn before God, a vow of chastity? And here you
      bring me word that I am to break my oath! Return to your house and pray to
      God, and to-morrow we shall see what will happen. God be with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      After much discussion, they left the hermit and returned home
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut the story short, our hermit, at the accustomed time set forth,
      carrying a hollow stick instead of a staff, and putting it near the pillow
      of the foolish woman, delivered much the same message as on the previous
      night; and that being done, returned at once to his hermitage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good woman, filled with joy, rose early and related all the story to
      her daughter, showing how the vision of the previous night had been
      confirmed. "There is no time to be lost! We must go to the holy man!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They went, and he saw them coming, and took his breviary and acted the
      hypocrite as before, but God knows he was not thinking of his devotions.
      And just as he had finished, and was about to recommence, there were the
      two women in front of his hut saluting him, and you may fancy that the old
      lady hurried through her narration; whereupon the good man made the sign
      of the cross, and feigning great surprise, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh God! my Creator! What is this? Do with me as you will&mdash;though, if
      it were not for thy great grace, I am not worthy to perform such a great
      work!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But see, father!" said the much-abused and deceived woman: "the message
      is true, since the angel has again appeared unto me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In truth, my dear friend, this matter is of great importance and very
      difficult and strange, so that I yet can give but a doubtful reply. Not
      that I would tempt God by demanding another vision, but there is a saying
      'The third time is sure'. Therefore I beg and desire of you to let pass
      this night also, and await the pleasure of God, and if of His great mercy
      it please Him to show us also this night as on the previous nights, we
      will do as He bids us to His praise."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not with a good grace that the foolish old woman was induced to put
      off this act of obedience to God, but she knew the hermit was wiser than
      she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was in bed, and thinking over all these marvellous visions, this
      perverse hypocrite came down from his mountain, placed his hollow stick to
      her ear, as before, and commanded her, once for all, to obey the message
      and take her daughter to the hermit for the purpose mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not forget, as soon as it was day, to do her duty, and when she
      and her daughter had given thanks to God, they set out for the hermitage,
      where the hermit came forth to meet them, and saluted and blessed them in
      the name of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good woman, more joyous than ever, informed him of the last vision.
      The hermit took her by the hand and led her into the chapel, and the girl
      followed them. There they made most devout prayers to the all-powerful God
      who had vouchsafed to show them this mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the hermit delivered a short sermon, touching dreams, visions,
      apparitions, and revelations, which often come to certain people, and
      alluded to the cause for which they were there assembled, and God knows
      that he preached well and righteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since God willed and commanded that he should create a successor to the
      Pope, and had deigned to reveal His will not once or twice, but three
      times, he must needs believe and conclude that great results must follow
      from this deed. It is my opinion," he concluded, "that we should no longer
      defer the execution of His orders, seeing that we have already delayed so
      long, through refusing to believe in this holy vision."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is well said, father. What would it please you to do?" replied the
      old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will leave your fair daughter here," said the hermit, "and she and I
      will pray together, and moreover do whatever God shall teach us."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good widow was much pleased, and her daughter was content to obey.
      When the hermit found himself alone with the damsel, he made her strip
      entirely as though he would baptise her, and you may fancy that the hermit
      did not long remain dressed. But why make a long story? He lay with her so
      long, and so often repeated it both in his cell and at her home, that at
      last she could not leave the house for shame, for her belly began to
      swell,&mdash;at which you need not be told she was overjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the daughter rejoiced to find herself pregnant, the mother rejoiced
      a hundred times more, and the hypocritical hermit also pretended to
      rejoice at the news, though inwardly he was bitterly vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor credulous mother, really believing that her daughter would bring
      forth a son who should in due time be Pope of Rome, could not help
      relating the story to one of her intimate friends, who was as much
      astonished as though she had found horns growing on her head, but,
      nevertheless, suspected no trickery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ere long the neighbour had told the other male and female neighbours, how
      the daughter of such an one was pregnant by the holy hermit of a son who
      was to be Pope of Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what I tell you," she said, "the mother of the girl told me, and God
      revealed it to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The news soon spread through all the neighbouring towns. Soon afterwards
      the girl was brought to bed, and duly delivered of a female child, at
      which she and her foolish mother were both astonished and angry, and the
      neighbours also, who expected the holy hermit to have been there to
      receive the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The report spread quite as quickly as the previous one, and the hermit was
      one of the first to hear of it, and quickly fled into another country&mdash;I
      know not where&mdash;to deceive another woman or girl, or perhaps into the
      desert of Egypt to perform penance, with a contrite heart, for his sin.
      However that may be, the poor girl was dishonoured; which was a great
      pity, for she was fair, good, and amiable.

      STORY THE FIFTEENTH &mdash; THE CLEVER NUN.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De La Roche
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a nun whom a monk wished to deceive, and how he offered to shoo
        her his weapon that she might feel it, but brought with him a companion
        whom he put forward in his place, and of the answer she gave him.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the fair country of Brabant, near to a monastery of white monks (*), is
      situated a nunnery of devout and charitable nuns, but their name and order
      need not be mentioned.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) Either Carthusians, who wear white robes and hoods, or
     Dominicans who wear white robes and black hoods.
</pre>
    <p>
      The two convents being close together, there was always a barn for the
      threshers, as the saying is, for, thank God, the nuns were so kind-hearted
      that few who sought amorous intercourse with them were refused, provided
      only they were worthy to receive their favours.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, to come to the story, there was amongst these white monks, a young
      and handsome monk who fell in love with one of the nuns, and after some
      preliminaries, had the courage to ask her for the love of God to grant him
      her favours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nun, who knew how he was furnished, though she was by nature
      courteous, gave him a harsh and sharp reply. He was not to be rebuffed,
      however, but continued to implore her love with most humble requests,
      until the pretty nun was forced either to lose her reputation for
      courtesy, or give the monk what she had granted to many others as soon as
      she was asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said to him; "Truly you weary me with requests for that which honestly
      I ought not to give you. But I have heard what sort of weapon you carry,
      and if it be so you have not much to thank Nature for."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know who told you," replied the monk, "but I am sure that you
      will be satisfied with me, and I will prove to you that I am as good a man
      as any other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. I believe you are a man," said she "but your machine is so small
      that if you were to put it in a certain place, I should hardly know that
      it was there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is quite the reverse," said the monk, "and, if I were in that place, I
      would do so well that you would confess that those who gave me that
      reputation were liars."
    </p>
    <p>
      After these fair speeches, the kind nun, that she might know what he could
      do, and perhaps not forgetting her own share in the pleasure, told him to
      come to the window of her cell at midnight; for which favour he thanked
      her gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But at any rate," said she, "you shall not enter until I really know what
      sort of lance you carry, and whether you can be of use to me or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you please," replied the monk, and with that he quitted his mistress,
      and went straight to Brother Conrad, one of his companions, who was
      furnished, God knows how well, and for that reason was much esteemed in
      the nunnery.
    </p>
    <p>
      To him the young monk related how he had begged a favour of such an one,
      and how she had refused, doubting whether his foot would fit her shoe, but
      in the end had consented that he should come to her, but would first feel
      and know with what sort of lance he would charge against her shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not," said he, "a fine thick lance, such as I know she would
      desire to meet. Therefore I beg of you with all my heart, to come with me
      this night at the hour when I am to meet her, and you will do me the
      greatest service that ever one man did to another. I know very well that
      she will want to touch and handle the lance, and this is what you must do.
      You will be behind me; but do not speak. Then take my place, and put your
      great machine in her hand. She will open the door then, I expect, and you
      will go away and I will enter in,&mdash;and leave the rest to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Conrad greatly doubted whether it would happen as his friend
      wished, but he agreed to do as he was asked. At the appointed hour they
      set forth to visit the nun. When they came to the window, the young monk,
      who was more eager than a stallion, knocked once with his stick, and the
      nun did not wait for him to knock a second time, but opened the window,
      and said in a low voice;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is I," he replied; "Open your door, lest anyone should hear us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my faith," quoth she, "you shall not be entered on the roll of my
      lovers, until you have passed a review, and I know what equipments you
      have. Come hither, and show me what it is like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willingly," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Brother Conrad took his place, and slipped into the nun's hand his
      fine, powerful weapon, which was thick, long, and round. But as soon as
      she felt it she recognized it, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! No! I know that well enough. That is the lance of Brother Conrad.
      There is not a nun here who does not know it! You thought I should be
      deceived, but I know too much for you! Go and try your luck elsewhere!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that she closed the window, being very angry and ill-pleased, not
      with Brother Conrad, but with the other monk; and they after this
      adventure, returned to their convent, pondering over all that had
      happened.

      STORY THE SIXTEENTH &mdash; ON THE BLIND SIDE. <a href="#linklinknote-16"
      name="linklinknoteref-16" id="linklinknoteref-16">16</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur Le Duc.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a knight of Picardy who went to Prussia, and, meanwhile his lady
        took a lover, and was in bed with him when her husband returned; and how
        by a cunning trick she got her lover out of the room without the knight
        being aware of it.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the County of Artois there lived formerly a noble knight, rich and
      powerful, and married to a beautiful dame of high family. These two lived
      together for long, and passed their days in peace and happiness. And
      because the most powerful Duke of Burgundy, Count of Artois, and their
      lord, was then at peace with all the great princes of Christendom, the
      knight, who was most devout, reflected that he ought to offer to God the
      body which had been given him, and which was fair and strong, and as
      well-formed as that of any man in that country, save that he had lost an
      eye in a battle. To perform the vow he had made,&mdash;after he had taken
      leave of his wife and relatives, he betook himself to the noble knights of
      Prussia,&mdash;the true defenders of the holy-Christian church (*); and in
      Prussia he fought valiantly and had many adventures&mdash;which I pass
      over here&mdash;and at the end was safe and sound, though he had shown
      great prowess, and the reports of his valour had been widely spread about
      by those who had seen them and returned to their own country, or by the
      letters they had written to many who had heard of his deeds with much
      pleasure.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) Doubtless there was a confusion In the writer's mind
     between Prussia and Hungary, and he alludes to the Crusade
     against the Turks which ended disastrously for the Crusaders
     in 1396, and in which Jean sans Peur and many Burgundian
     knights took part.
</pre>
    <p>
      Now you must know that his lady, who stayed at home, had bestowed her
      affection on a squire who sought her love, and was glad to have a
      substitute for her liege lord, who was away fighting the Saracens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst my lord was fasting and doing penance, my lady made good cheer with
      the squire; often did my lord dine and sup on bread and water, whilst my
      lady was enjoying all the good things which God had given her in plenty;
      my lord,&mdash;if he could do no better,&mdash;lay upon straw, and my lady
      rested in a fine bed with the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut matters short, whilst my lord was fighting the Saracens, my lady
      was indulging in another sort of combat with the squire, and did so well
      thereat, that if my lord had never returned he would not have been much
      missed or regretted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight finding that&mdash;thanks be to God&mdash;the Saracens were no
      longer on the offensive; and that it was a long time since he had seen his
      home, and his good wife, who much desired and regretted him, as she had
      many times told him in her letters, prepared to return, and started with
      the few retainers he had. And he fared so well, owing to the great desire
      he had to return to his home, and the arms of his wife, that in a few days
      he was near there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being more anxious than any of his followers, he was always the first to
      rise, and the foremost on the journey. In fact, he made such speed that he
      often rode alone, a quarter of a league or more ahead of his retainers.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, it chanced the knight had lodged about six leagues from his home.
      He rose early in the morning and mounted his horse, intending to arrive at
      his house before his wife, who knew nothing of his coming, was awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He set out as he intended, and, when on the road, he said to his
      followers, "Come at your leisure; there is no need for you to follow me. I
      will ride on fast that I may surprise my wife in bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      His retainers being weary, and their horses also, did not oppose his
      wishes, but travelled along at their ease, though they had some fears for
      the knight, who rode thus fast in the dark and alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made such speed that soon he was in the courtyard of his castle, where
      he found a serving-man, to whom he gave his horse; then, in his boots and
      spurs, he went straight, and without meeting any one, for it was yet early
      in the morning, towards the chamber where my lady slept, and where the
      squire was doing that which the knight longed to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may guess that the squire and the lady were both astonished when the
      knight thundered on the door&mdash;which was locked&mdash;with his staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is there?" asked the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is I," replied the knight. "Open the door!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, who knew her husband's voice, did not feel comfortable;
      nevertheless she caused the squire to dress himself which he did as
      quickly as he could, wondering how he should escape from his dangerous
      position. She meanwhile pretended to be asleep, and not recognise her
      husband's voice, and when he knocked at the door a second time, she asked
      again, "Who is there?" "It is your husband, wife! Open the door quickly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband?" said she. "Alas, he is far from here! May God soon bring him
      back in safety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my soul, wife, I am your husband! Did you not know my voice? I knew
      yours as soon as I heard you speak."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When he does come, I shall know of it long beforehand, that I may receive
      him as I ought, and that I may call together his relations and friends to
      wish him a hearty welcome. Go away! Go away! and let me sleep!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John I will take care you do not! Open the door! Do you not know
      your own husband?" and with that he called her by her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that her lover was by that time quite ready, and made him stand
      behind the door. Then she said to the knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it really you? For God's sake pardon me! And are you in good health?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; thank God," said the knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God be praised!" said the lady. "I will come directly and let you in; but
      I am not dressed, and must get a candle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take your time!" said the knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly," said the lady, "just as you knocked, my lord, I was much
      disturbed by a dream I had about you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what was that, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, my lord! I dreamed that you came back, and talked with me, and
      that you saw as well with one eye as with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would to God it were so," said my lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By our Lady," said his wife, "I believe it is as I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my word", replied the knight, "you are very foolish. How could it be
      so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I maintain," said she, "that it is so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing of the kind," said the knight. "You must be mad to think
      so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my lord," she replied, "you will never make me believe it is not as I
      say, and, to set my mind at rest, I ask of you to give me a proof."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon she opened the door, holding a lighted candle in her hand, and
      he, not displeased at her words, permitted her to make trial, and thus the
      poor man allowed her to cover up his eye with her one hand, whilst with
      the other she held the candle before his blind eye. Then she said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord! on your oath, can you not see well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I swear I cannot," said my lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst this trick was being played, my lord's substitute stole out of the
      chamber without being perceived by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait a moment, my lord," said she. "<i>Now</i> cannot you see well? Tell
      me the truth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, by God, my dear," replied the knight. "How should I see? You have
      stopped up my right eye, and the other I lost more than ten years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said she, "I see it was but an idle, foolish dream; but, be that
      as it may, God be praised and thanked that you are here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen," said the knight, and with that he kissed and embraced her many
      times, and they rejoiced greatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And my lord did not forget to tell her how he had left his retainers
      behind, and what speed he had made that he might find her in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly," said my lady, "you are a good husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that there came women and other servants, who took off the
      knight's armour, and undressed him. That being done, he got into bed with
      the lady, and enjoyed what the squire had left&mdash;who, for his part,
      meanwhile went his way, happy and joyful to have escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus was the knight deceived, as you have heard; nor was he ever informed
      of it that I am aware, though it was known to many people.

    <h2>
      STORY THE SEVENTEENTH &mdash; THE LAWYER AND THE BOLTING-MILL.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur Le Duc.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a President of Parliament, who fell in love with his chamber-maid,
        and would have forced her whilst she was sifting flour, but by fair
        speaking she dissuaded him, and made him shake the sieve whilst she went
        unto her mistress, who came and found her husband thus, as you will
        afterwards hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      There lived formerly at Paris a President of the Court of Accounts, who
      was a learned clerk, a knight, and a man of ripe age, but right joyous and
      pleasant to both men and women.
    </p>
    <p>
      This worthy lord had married a woman who was both elderly and sickly, and
      by her had divers children. And amongst the other damsels, waiting women,
      and servant maids in his house, was a serving-wench whom nature had made
      most fair, and who did the household work; made the beds, baked the bread,
      and did other low offices. The gentleman, who made love whenever he found
      a chance, did not conceal from the fair wench his intentions towards her,
      and made attempts upon her virtue, promising her many rich gifts, and
      explaining to her that it was her duty to let him have his way, and trying
      first this way and then that to seduce her. But he was grieved to find
      that he could not induce her to return his love. The girl was wise and
      chaste, and not so foolish as to grant her master any favour, but spoke
      him so fairly that he did not lose heart, though he would have preferred a
      different kind of answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he found that kindness was of no use, he tried harshness and rough
      words, but the wench was not frightened, and told him that, "He might do
      as he pleased, but whilst she had life she would never let him near her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman, seeing that her mind was fully made-up, spake no more to
      her for some days, but spared not loving looks and signs; which much
      annoyed her, and if she had not feared to make discord between husband and
      wife, she would have told the latter how unfaithful her spouse was, but,
      in the end, she resolved to conceal this as long as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The infatuation of the old man increased every day, and begging and
      praying no longer sufficed. He went to her and renewed his entreaties and
      vows, which he confirmed by a hundred thousand oaths. But&mdash;to cut
      matters short&mdash;it was all no good; he could not obtain a single word,
      or the least shadow of hope, that he would ever attain his purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he left her, but he did not forget to say that if ever he found
      a favourable opportunity she would have to comply with his wishes, or it
      would be the worse for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wench was not much frightened, thought no more of it, and went about
      her duties as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time afterwards, one Monday morning, the pretty servant, having some
      pies to make, was sifting meal. Now you must know that the room where she
      was thus engaged, was not far from her master's bedroom, and he heard the
      noise of the sieve, and knew very well that it was made by the
      servant-girl at her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought that perhaps she was not alone, but, if she should be, he would
      never find a better chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said to himself, "Though she has often refused me by word of mouth, I
      shall succeed at last if I only keep to my purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was early dawn, and his wife was not awake, at which he was glad. He
      stole quietly out of bed; put on his dressing-gown and his slippers, and
      crept to the damsel's room so quietly that she never knew he was there
      until she saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl was much astonished, and trembled; suspecting that her
      master had come to take that which she would never give him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing she was frightened, he said nothing but attacked her with such
      violence that he would soon have taken the place by storm if she had not
      sued for peace. She said to him;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, sir, I beg for mercy! My life and honour are in your hands;&mdash;have
      pity on me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care nothing about honour," said her master, who was very hot and
      excited. "You are in my hands and cannot escape me," and with that he
      attacked her more violently than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, finding resistance was useless, bethought herself of a
      stratagem, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I prefer to surrender of free-will than by force. Leave me alone,
      and I will do all that you may require."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said her master, "but be sure that I will not let you go
      free."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is but one thing I would beg of you, sir" replied the girl. "I
      greatly fear that my mistress may hear you; and if, by chance, she should
      come and find you here, I should be lost and ruined, for she would either
      beat me or kill me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She is not likely to come," said he, "she is sleeping soundly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, sir, I am in great fear of her and, as I would be assured, I beg
      and request of you, for my peace of mind and our greater security in what
      we are about to do, that you let me go and see whether she is sleeping, or
      what she is doing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By our Lady! you would never return," said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I swear that I will," she replied, "and that speedily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good then," said he. "Make haste!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, sir," said she. "It would be well that you should take this sieve and
      work as I was doing; so that if my lady should by chance awake, she will
      hear the noise and know that I am at work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give it to me, and I will work well;&mdash;but do not stay long."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, sir. Hold this sieve, and you will look like a woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that, God knows I care not," said he, and with that laid hold of
      the sieve and began to work it as best he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the virtuous wench mounted to her lady's room and woke her, and
      told her how her husband had attempted her virtue, and attacked her whilst
      she was sifting meal, "And if it please you to come and see how I escaped
      him," she said, "come down with me and behold him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady rose at once, put on her dress, and was soon before the door of
      the room where her lord was diligently sifting. And when she saw him thus
      employed, and struggling with the sieve, she said to him;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, master, what is this? Where are now all your learning, your honour,
      your knowledge and prudence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw that he had been deceived, and replied quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wife, they are all collected at the end of my c&mdash;k.", and with that,
      being much annoyed and angry, he threw down the sieve and went back to his
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife followed him, and began to lecture him again, but he paid little
      heed. When he was ready, he ordered his mule, and went to the palace,
      where he related his adventure to divers gentlemen, who laughed loudly
      thereat. And, although he was at first angry with the wench, he afterwards
      helped her, by his influence and rich gifts, to find a husband.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De La Roche.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a gentleman of Burgundy who paid a chambermaid ten crowns to sleep
        with her, but before he left her room, had his ten crowns back, and made
        her carry him on her shoulders through the host's chamber. And in
        passing by the said chamber he let wind so loudly that all was known, as
        you will hear in the story which follows.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A gentleman of Burgundy went on some business to Paris, and lodged at a
      good inn, for it was his custom always to seek out the best lodgings. He
      knew a thing or two, and he noticed that the chambermaid did not look a
      sort of woman who was afraid of a man. So, without much ado, or making two
      bites at a cherry, he asked if he could sleep with her?
    </p>
    <p>
      But she set her back up at once. "How dare you make such a proposal to
      me," she said. "I would have you to know that I am not one of those girls
      who bring scandal upon the houses in which they live." And in short, for
      all he could say she refused to have anything to do with him "for any
      money."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman who knew well what all these protestations were worth, said
      to her;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, if fitting time and place were given me, I would tell you
      something you would be glad to learn; but as, perhaps, it might hurt your
      reputation if you were seen conversing with me, talk to my valet, and he
      will arrange matters on my behalf."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have nothing to say either to him or to you," she replied, and with
      that she walked away, and the gentleman called his valet, who was a clever
      rogue, and ordered him to follow her and win her over at any cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valet, who was well trained, promised that he would perform his task,
      and, as soon as he found her, set to work to employ honied phrases, and if
      she had not been of Paris, and not the least cunning of the women of that
      city, his soft speeches and the promises he made on behalf of his master,
      would soon have gained her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as it was, after much talk between them, she cut matters short by
      saying;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know well what your master wants, but he shall not touch me unless I
      have ten crowns."
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant reported this to his master, who was not so generous, or at
      least not in such a case, as to give ten crowns to enjoy a kitchen wench.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be that as it may," replied the valet, "she will not budge from that; and
      even then you must use precautions in going to her chamber, for you must
      pass through that of the host. What do you intend to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath!" said his master, "I regret sorely having to pay ten crowns,
      but I am so smitten with the wench that I cannot give her up. To the devil
      with avarice! she shall have the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I tell her then you will give her the money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, in the devil's name! Yes!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The valet found the girl, and told her she should have the money, and
      perhaps something more.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut matters short, a time was arranged for the gentleman to come to
      her, but, before she would show him the way to her room, she insisted on
      the ten crowns being paid down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Burgundian was not over-pleased, and as he was on the way to her
      chamber, it struck him that he was paying dearly for his amusement, and he
      resolved that he would play her a trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stole into her room so quietly that neither the host nor his wife
      awaked. There he undressed, and said to himself that he would at least
      have his money's worth. He did marvels, and got as good as he sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      What with jesting and other matters, the hours passed quickly, and dawn
      was near. He was then more willing to sleep than to do anything else, but
      the fair chambermaid said to him;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I have heard and seen so much of your nobleness, honour, and
      courtesy that I have consented to allow you to take that which I hold
      dearest in all the world. I now beg and request of you that you will at
      once dress and hasten away, for it is now day, and if by chance my master
      or mistress should come here, as is often their custom in the morning, and
      should find you here, I should be dishonoured, nor would it do you any
      good."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care not," quoth he, "what good or evil may happen, but here I will
      remain, and sleep at my ease and leisure before I leave. I am entitled to
      that for my money. Do you think you have so easily earned my ten crowns?
      You took them quickly enough. By St. George! I have no fear; but I will
      stay here and you shall bear me company, if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, sir," she replied, "by my soul I cannot do this. You must leave. It
      will be full day directly, and if you are found here what will become of
      me? I would rather die than that should happen; and if you do not make
      haste I much fear some one will come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let them come," said the gentleman. "I care not, but, I tell you plainly,
      that until you give me back my ten crowns, I will not leave here, happen
      what may."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your ten crowns?" she answered. "Are you a man of that sort, and so
      devoid of any courtesy or grace as to take back from me in that fashion,
      that which you have given? By my faith that is not the way to prove
      yourself a gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever I am," said he, "I will not leave here, or shall you either,
      until you have given me back my ten crowns; you gained them too easily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May God help me," she replied, "though you speak thus I do not believe
      you would be so ungrateful, after the pleasure I have given you, or so
      discorteous, as not to aid me to preserve my honour, and therefore I beg
      of you to grant my request, and leave here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman said that he would do nothing of the sort, and in the end
      the poor girl was forced&mdash;though God knows with what regret&mdash;to
      hand-over the ten crowns in order to make him go. When the money had
      returned to the hand that gave it, the girl was very angry, but the man
      was in great glee.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," said the girl, angrily, "that you have thus tricked and deceived
      me, at least make haste. Let it suffice that you have made a fool of me,
      and do not by delay bring dishonour upon me by being seen here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have nothing to do with your honour," said he. "Keep it as much as
      like, but you brought me here and you must take me back to the place from
      whence I came, for I do not intend to have the double trouble of coming
      and returning."
    </p>
    <p>
      The chambermaid, seeing that she only made him more obstinate, and that
      day was breaking fast, took the gentleman on her back, and though sick at
      heart with fear and anger, began to carry him. And as she was picking her
      way carefully and noiselessly, this courteous gentleman, who after having
      ridden on her belly was now riding on her back, broke wind so loudly that
      the host awoke, and called out in his fright;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is your chambermaid," said the gentleman, "who is taking me back to
      the place from whence she brought me."
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the poor girl's heart and strength failed her. She could no
      longer bear her unpleasant burden, and she fell on the floor and rolled
      one way, whilst the squire went rolling the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host, who knew what was the matter, spoke sharply to the girl, who
      soon afterwards left his house; and the gentleman returned to Burgundy,
      where he often gleefully related to his gallant companions the above
      written adventure.

      <br /> <br /> STORY THE NINETEENTH &mdash; THE CHILD OF THE SNOW. <a
      href="#linklinknote-19" name="linklinknoteref-19" id="linklinknoteref-19">19</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      By Philippe Vignier.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of an English merchant whose wife had a child in his absence, and
        told him that it was his; and how he cleverly got rid of the child&mdash;for
        his wife having asserted that it was born of the snow, he declared it
        had been melted by the sun.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Moved by a strong desire to see and know foreign countries, and to meet
      with adventures, a worthy and rich merchant of London left his fair and
      good wife, his children, relations, friends, estates, and the greater part
      of his possessions, and quitted the kingdom, well furnished with money and
      great abundance of merchandise, such as England can supply to foreign
      countries, and with many other things which, for the sake of brevity, I do
      not mention here.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this first voyage, the good merchant wandered about for a space of five
      years, during which time his good wife looked after his property, disposed
      of much merchandise profitably, and managed so well that her husband, when
      he returned at the end of five years, greatly praised her, and loved her
      more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merchant, not content with the many strange and wonderful things he
      had seen, or with the large fortune he had made, four or five months after
      his return, again set forth in quest of adventures in foreign lands, both
      Christian and pagan, and stayed there so long that ten years passed before
      his wife again saw him, but he often wrote to her, that she might know
      that he was still alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was young and lusty, and wanted not any of the goods that God could
      give, except the presence of her husband. His long absence constrained her
      to provide herself with a lover, by whom shortly she had a fine boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This son was nourished and brought up with the others, his half-brothers,
      and, when the merchant returned, was about seven years old.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great were the rejoicings between husband and wife when he came back, and
      whilst they were conversing pleasantly, the good woman, at the demand of
      her husband, caused to be brought all their children, not omitting the one
      who had been born during the absence of him whose name she bore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy merchant seeing all these children, and remembering perfectly
      how many there should be, found one over and above; at which he was much
      astonished and surprised, and he inquired of his wife who was this fair
      son, the youngest of their children?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?" said she; "On my word, husband, he is our son! Who else
      should he be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know," he replied, "but, as I have never seen him before, is it
      strange that I should ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, by St. John," said she; "but he is our son."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can that be?" said her husband. "You were not pregnant when I left."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly I was not, so far as I know," she replied, "but I can swear that
      the child is yours, and that no other man but you has ever lain with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never said so," he answered, "but, at any rate, it is ten years since I
      left, and this child does not appear more than seven. How then can it be
      mine? Did you carry him longer than you did the others?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath, I know not!" she said; "but what I tell you is true. Whether
      I carried it longer than the others I know not, and if you did not make it
      before you left, I do not know how it could have come, unless it was that,
      not long after your departure, I was one day in our garden, when suddenly
      there came upon me a longing and desire to eat a leaf of sorrel, which at
      that time was thickly covered with snow. I chose a large and fine leaf, as
      I thought, and ate it, but it was only a white and hard piece of snow. And
      no sooner had I eaten it than I felt myself to be in the same condition as
      I was before each of my other children was born. In fact, a certain time
      afterwards, I bore you this fair son."
    </p>
    <p>
      The merchant saw at once that he was being fooled, but he pretended to
      believe the story his wife had told him, and replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, though what you tell me is hardly possible, and has never
      happened to anyone else, let God be praised for what He has sent us. If He
      has given us a child by a miracle, or by some secret method of which we
      are ignorant, He has not forgotten to provide us with the wherewithal to
      keep it."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the good woman saw that her husband was willing to believe the tale
      she told him, she was greatly pleased. The merchant, who was both wise and
      prudent, stayed at home the next ten years, without making any other
      voyages, and in all that time breathed not a word to his wife to make her
      suspect he knew aught of her doings, so virtuous and patient was he.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not yet tired of travelling, and wished to begin again. He told
      his wife, who was very dissatisfied thereat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be at ease," he said, "and, if God and St. George so will, I will return
      shortly. And as our son, who was born during my last voyage, is now grown
      up, and capable of seeing and learning, I will, if it seem good to you,
      take him with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my word", said she "I hope you will, and you will do well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall be done," he said, and thereupon he started, and took with him
      the young man, of whom he was not the father, and for whom he felt no
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a good wind, and came to the port of Alexandria, where the good
      merchant sold the greater part of his merchandise very well. But he was
      not so foolish as to keep at his charge a child his wife had had by some
      other man, and who, after his death, would inherit like the other
      children, so he sold the youth as a slave, for good money paid down, and
      as the lad was young and strong, nearly a hundred ducats was paid for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this was done, the merchant returned to London, safe and sound, thank
      God. And it need not be told how pleased his wife was to see him in good
      health, but when she saw her son was not there, she knew not what to
      think.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not conceal her feelings, and asked her husband what had become
      of their son?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my dear," said he, "I will not conceal from you that a great
      misfortune has befallen him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, what?" she asked. "Is he drowned?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but the truth is that the wind and waves wafted us to a country that
      was so hot that we nearly died from the great heat of the sun. And one day
      when we had all left the ship, in order that we each might dig a hole in
      which to shield ourselves from the heat,&mdash;our dear son, who, as you
      know was made of snow, began to melt in the sun, and in our presence was
      turned into water, and ere you could have said one of the seven psalms,
      there was nothing left of him. Thus strangely did he come into the world,
      and thus suddenly did he leave it. I both was, and am, greatly vexed, and
      not one of all the marvels I have ever seen astonished me so greatly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" said she. "Since it has pleased God to give and to take away, His
      name be praised."
    </p>
    <p>
      As to whether she suspected anything or not, the history is silent and
      makes no mention, but perhaps she learned that her husband was not to be
      hood-winked.

      STORY THE TWENTIETH &mdash; THE HUSBAND AS DOCTOR.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Philippe De Laon.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a young squire of Champagne who, when he married, had never
        mounted a Christian creature,&mdash;much to his wife's regret. And of
        the method her mother found to instruct him, and how the said squire
        suddenly wept at a great feast that was made shortly after he had
        learned how to perform the carnal act&mdash;as you will hear more
        plainly hereafter.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It is well known that in the province of Champagne you are sure to meet
      heavy and dull-witted persons&mdash;which has seemed strange to many
      persons, seeing that the district is so near to the country of Mischief.
      (*) Many stories could be told of the stupidity of the Champenois, but
      this present story will suffice.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) <i>Mal-Eugen</i> in the original. The author probably means
     Picardy or Lorraine.
</pre>
    <p>
      In this province, there lived a young man, an orphan, who at the death of
      his father and mother had become rich and powerful. He was stupid,
      ignorant, and disagreeable, but hard-working and knew well how to take
      care of himself and his affairs, and for this reason, many persons,&mdash;even
      people of condition,&mdash;were willing to give him their daughter in
      marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these damsels, above all others, pleased the friends and relations
      of our Champenois, for her beauty, goodness, riches, and so forth. They
      told him that it was time he married.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are now," they said, "twenty-three years old, and there could not be
      a better time. And if you will listen to us, we have searched out for you
      a fair and good damsel who seems to us just suited to you. It is such an
      one&mdash;you know her well;" and they told him her name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, who cared little whether he was married or not, as long as
      he lost no money by it, replied that he would do whatever they wished.
      "Since you think it will be to my advantage, manage the business the best
      way you can, and I will follow your advice and instructions."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say well," replied these good people. "We will select your wife as
      carefully as though it were for ourselves, or one of our children."
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut matters short, a little time afterwards our Champenois was married;
      but on the first night, when he was sleeping with his wife, he, never
      having mounted on any Christian woman, soon turned his back to her, and a
      few poor kisses was all she had of him, but nothing on her back. You may
      guess his wife was not well pleased at this; nevertheless, she concealed
      her discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      This unsatisfactory state of things lasted ten days, and would have
      continued longer if the girl's mother had not put a stop to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be known to you that the young man was unskilled in the
      mysteries of wedlock, for during the lifetime of his parents he had been
      kept with a tight hand, and, above all things, had been forbidden to play
      at the beast with two backs, lest he should take too much delight therein,
      and waste all his patrimony. This was wise of his parents, for he was not
      a young man likely to be loved for his good looks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he would do nothing to anger his father or mother, and was, moreover,
      not of an amorous disposition, he had always preserved his chastity,
      though his wife would willingly have deprived him of it, if she had known
      how to do so honestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the mother of the bride came to her daughter, and asked her all
      about her husband's state and condition, and the thousand other things
      which women like to know. To all of these questions the bride replied that
      her husband was a good man, and she hoped and believed that she would be
      happy with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the old woman knew by her own experience that there are more things in
      married life than eating and drinking, so she said to her daughter;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, and tell me, on your word of honour, how does he acquit
      himself at night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      When the girl heard this question she was so vexed and ashamed that she
      could not reply, and her eyes filled with tears. Her mother understood
      what these tears meant, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not weep, my child! Speak out boldly! I am your mother, and you ought
      not to conceal anything from me, or be afraid of telling me. Has he done
      nothing to you yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl, having partly recovered, and being re-assured by her
      mother's words, ceased her tears, but yet could make no reply. Thereupon,
      her mother asked again;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lay aside your grief and answer me honestly: has he done nothing to you
      yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a low voice, mingled with tears, the girl replied, "On my word, mother,
      he has never yet touched me, but, except for that, there is no more kind
      or affectionate man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me," said the mother; "do you know if he is properly furnished with
      all his members? Speak out boldly, if you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John! he is all right in that respect," replied the bride. "I have
      often, by chance, felt his luggage as I turned to and fro in our bed when
      I could not sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is enough," said the mother; "leave the rest to me. This is what <i>you</i>
      must do. In the morning you must pretend to be very ill&mdash;even as
      though your soul were departing from your body. Your husband will, I fully
      expect, seek me out and bid me come to you, and I will play my part so
      well that your business will be soon settled, for I shall take your water
      to a certain doctor, who will give such advice as I order."
    </p>
    <p>
      All was done as arranged, for on the morrow, as soon as it was dawn, the
      girl, who was sleeping with her husband, began to complain and to sham
      sickness as though a strong fever racked her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her booby husband was much vexed and astonished, and knew not what to say
      or do. He sent forthwith for his mother-in-law, who was not long in
      coming. As soon as he saw her, "Alas! mother!" said he, "your daughter is
      dying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My daughter?" said she. "What does she want?" and whilst she was speaking
      she walked to the patient's chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the mother saw her daughter, she asked what was the matter; and
      the girl, being well instructed what she was to do, answered not at first,
      but, after a little time, said, "Mother, I am dying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall not die, please God! Take courage! But how comes it that you
      are taken ill so suddenly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know! I do not know!" replied the girl. "It drives me wild to
      answer all these questions."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman took the girl's hand, and felt her pulse; then she said to
      her son-in-law;
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my word she is very ill. She is full of fire, and we must find some
      remedy. Have you any of her water?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That which she made last night is there," said one of the attendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give it me," said the mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took the urine, and put it in a proper vessel, and told her son-in-law
      that she was about to show it to such-and-such a doctor, that he might
      know what he could do to her daughter to cure her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For God's sake spare nothing," said she. "I have yet some money left, but
      I love my daughter better than money."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Spare!" quoth he. "If money can help, you shall not want."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need to go so fast," said she. "Whilst she is resting, I will go home;
      but I will come back if I am wanted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that the old woman had on the previous day, when she
      left her daughter, instructed the doctor, who was well aware of what he
      ought to say. So the young man carried his wife's water to the doctor, and
      when he had saluted him, related how sick and suffering his wife was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I have brought you some of her water that you may judge how ill she
      is, and more easily cure her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor took the vessel of urine, and turned it about and examined it,
      then said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your wife is afflicted with a sore malady, and is in danger of dying
      unless help be forthcoming; her water shows it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, master, for God's sake tell me what to do, and I will pay you well if
      you can restore her to health, and prevent her from dying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She need not die," said the doctor; "but unless you make haste, all the
      money in the world will not save her life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, for God's sake," said the other, "what to do, and I will do it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She must," said the doctor, "have connection with a man, or she will
      die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Connection with a man?" said the other, "What is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is to say," continued the doctor, "that you must mount on the top of
      her, and speedily ram her three or four times, or more if you can; for, if
      not, the great heat which is consuming her will not be put out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! will that be good for her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no chance of her living," said the doctor, "if you do not do it,
      and quickly too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John," said the other, "I will try what I can do."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he went home and found his wife, who was groaning and lamenting
      loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you, my dear?" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am dying, my dear," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall not die, please God," said he. "I have seen the doctor, who has
      told me what medicine will cure you," and as he spoke, he undressed
      himself, and lay down by his wife, and began to execute the orders he had
      received from the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing?" said she. "Do you want to kill me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No! I am going to cure you," he replied. "The doctor said so;" and Nature
      instructing him, and the patient helping, he performed on her two or three
      times.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was resting from his labours, much astonished at what had
      happened, he asked his wife how she was?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a little better than I was before;" she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God be praised," said he. "I hope you will get well and that the doctor
      told me truly:" and with that he began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut matters short, he performed so well that his wife was cured in a
      few days, at which he was very joyful, and so was her mother when she knew
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man after this became a better fellow than he was before, and
      his wife being now restored to health, he one day invited all his
      relations and friends to dinner, and also the father and mother of his
      wife, and he served grand cheer after his own fashion. They drank to him,
      and he drank to them, and he was marvellous good company.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hear what happened to him: in the midst of the dinner he began to
      weep, which much astonished all his friends who were at table with him,
      and they demanded what was the matter, but he could not reply for weeping
      scalding tears. At last he spoke, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have good cause to weep."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath you have not," replied his mother-in-law. "What ails you? You
      are rich and powerful, and well housed, and have good friends; and you
      must not forget that you have a fair and good wife whom God brought back
      to health when she was on the edge of the grave. In my opinion you ought
      to be light-hearted and joyful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said he, "woe is me! My father and mother, who both loved me, and
      who amassed and left me so much wealth, are both dead, and by my fault,
      for they died of a fever, and if I had well towzled them both when they
      were ill, as I did to my wife, they would still be on their feet."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one at table who, on hearing this, would not have liked to
      laugh, nevertheless they restrained themselves as best they could. The
      tables were removed, and each went his way, and the young man continued to
      live with his wife, and&mdash;in order that she might continue in good
      health&mdash;he failed not to tail her pretty often.

      STORY THE TWENTY-FIRST &mdash; THE ABBESS CURED <a href="#linklinknote-21"
      name="linklinknoteref-21" id="linklinknoteref-21">21</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Philippe De Laon.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of an abbess who was ill for want of&mdash;you know what&mdash;but
        would not have it done, fearing to be reproached by her nuns, but they
        all agreed to do the same and most willingly did so.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In Normandy there is a fair nunnery, the Abbess of which was young, fair,
      and well-made. It chanced that she fell ill. The good sisters who were
      charitable and devout, hastened to visit her, and tried to comfort her,
      and do all that lay in their power. And when they found she was getting no
      better, they commanded one of the sisters to go to Rouen, and take her
      water to a renowned doctor of that place.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the next day one of the nuns started on this errand, and when she
      arrived there she showed the water to the physician, and described at
      great length the illness of the Lady Abbess, how she slept, ate, drank,
      etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      The learned doctor understood the case, both from his examination of the
      water, and the information given by the nun, and then he gave his
      prescription.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I know that it is the custom in many cases to give a prescription in
      writing, nevertheless this time he gave it by word of mouth, and said to
      the nun;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fair sister, for the abbess to recover her health there is but one
      remedy, and that is that she must have company with a man; otherwise in a
      short time she will grew so bad that death will be the only remedy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our nun was much astonished to hear such sad news, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! Master John! is there no other method by which our abbess can
      recover her health?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly not," he replied; "there is no other, and moreover, you must
      make haste to do as I have bid you, for if the disease is not stopped and
      takes its course, there is no man living who could cure it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good nun, though much disconcerted, made haste to announce the news to
      the Abbess, and by the aid of her stout cob, and the great desire she had
      to be at home, made such speed that the abbess was astonished to see her
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What says the doctor, my dear?" cried the abbess. "Is there any fear of
      death?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be soon in good health if God so wills, madam," said the
      messenger. "Be of good cheer, and take heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! has not the doctor ordered me any medicine?" said the Abbess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," was the reply, and then the nun related how the doctor had looked
      at her water, and asked her age, and how she ate and slept, etc. "And then
      in conclusion he ordered that you must have, somehow or other, carnal
      connection with some man, or otherwise you will shortly be dead, for there
      is no other remedy for your complaint."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Connection with a man!" cried the lady. "I would rather die a thousand
      times if it were possible." And then she went on, "Since it is thus, and
      my illness is incurable and deadly unless I take such a remedy, let God be
      praised! I will die willingly. Call together quickly all the convent!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell was rung, and all the nuns flocked round the Abbess, and, when
      they were all in the chamber, the Abbess, who still had the use of her
      tongue, however ill she was, began a long speech concerning the state of
      the church, and in what condition she had found it and how she left it,
      and then went on to speak of her illness, which was mortal and incurable
      as she well knew and felt, and as such and such a physician had also
      declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so, my dear sisters, I recommend to you our church, and that you pray
      for my poor soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words, tears in great abundance welled from all eyes, and the
      heart's fountain of the convent was moved. This weeping lasted long, and
      none of the company spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some time, the Prioress, who was wise and good, spoke for all the
      convent, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, your illness&mdash;what it is, God, from whom nothing is hidden,
      alone knows&mdash;vexes us greatly, and there is not one of us who would
      not do all in her power to aid your recovery. We therefore pray you to
      spare nothing, not even the goods of the Church, for it would be better
      for us to lose the greater part of our temporal goods than be deprived of
      the spiritual profit which your presence gives us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good sister," said the Abbess, "I have not deserved your kind offer,
      but I thank you as much as I can, and again advise and beg of you to take
      care of the Church&mdash;as I have already said&mdash;for it is a matter
      which concerns me closely, God knows; and pray also for my poor soul,
      which hath great need of your prayers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, madam," said the Prioress, "is it not possible that by great care,
      or the diligent attention of some physician, that you might be restored to
      health?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, my good sister," replied the Abbess. "You must number me among
      the dead&mdash;for I am hardly alive now, though I can still talk to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then stepped forth the nun who had carried the water to Rouen, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, there is a remedy if you would but try it." "I do not choose to,"
      replied the Abbess. "Here is sister Joan, who has returned from Rouen, and
      has shown my water, and related my symptoms, to such and such a physician,
      who has declared that I shall die unless I suffer some man to approach me
      and have connection with me. By this means he hopes, and his books
      informed him, that I should escape death; but if I did not do as he bade
      me, there was no help for me. But as for me, I thank God that He has
      deigned to call me, though I have sinned much. I yield myself to His will,
      and my body is prepared for death, let it come when it may."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, madam!" said the infirmary nun, "would you murder yourself? It is
      in your power to save yourself, and you have but to put forth your hand
      and ask for aid, and you will find it ready! That is not right; and I even
      venture to tell you that you are imperilling your soul if you die in that
      condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sister," said the Abbess, "how many times have I told you that it
      is better for a person to die than commit a deadly sin. You know that I
      cannot avoid death except by committing a deadly sin. Also I feel sure
      that even by prolonging my life by this means, I should be dishonoured for
      ever, and a reproach to all. Folks would say of me, 'There is the lady who
      &mdash;&mdash;'.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All of you,&mdash;however you may advise me&mdash;would cease to
      reverence and love me, for I should seem&mdash;and with good cause&mdash;unworthy
      to preside over and govern you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must neither say nor think that," said the Treasurer. "There is
      nothing that we should not attempt to avoid death. Does not our good
      father, St. Augustine, say that it is not permissible to anyone to take
      his own life, nor to cut off one of his limbs? And are you not acting in
      direct opposition to his teaching, if you allow yourself to die when you
      could easily prevent it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She says well!" cried all the sisters in chorus. "Madam, for God's sake
      obey the physician, and be not so obstinate in your own opinion as to lose
      both your body and soul, and leave desolate, and deprived of your care,
      the convent where you are so much loved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear sisters," replied the Abbess, "I much prefer to bow my head to
      death than to live dishonoured. And would you not all say&mdash;'There is
      the woman who did so and so'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not worry yourself with what people would say: you would never be
      reproached by good and respectable people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I should be," replied the Abbess.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nuns were greatly moved, and retired and held a meeting, and passed a
      resolution, which the Prioress was charged to deliver to the Abbess, which
      she did in the following words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, the nuns are greatly grieved,&mdash;for never was any convent more
      troubled than this is, and you are the cause. We believe that you are
      ill-advised in allowing yourself to die when we are sure you could avoid
      it. And, in order that you should comprehend our loyal and single-hearted
      love for you, we have decided and concluded in a general assembly, to save
      you and ourselves, and if you have connection secretly with some
      respectable man, we will do the same, in order that you may not think or
      imagine that in time to come you can be reproached by any of us. Is it not
      so, my sisters?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," they all shouted most willingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Abbess heard the speech, and was much moved by the testimony of the
      love the sisters bore her, and consented, though with much regret, that
      the doctor's advice should be carried out. Monks, priests, and clerks were
      sent for, and they found plenty of work to do, and they worked so well
      that the Abbess was soon cured, at which the nuns were right joyous.

      href="#linklinknote-22" name="linklinknoteref-22" id="linklinknoteref-22">22</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Caron.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a gentleman who seduced a young girl, and then went away and
        joined the army. And before his return she made the acquaintance of
        another, and pretended her child was by him. When the gentleman returned
        from the war he claimed the child, but she begged him to leave it with
        her second lover, promising that the next she had she would give to him,
        as is hereafter recorded.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Formerly there was a gentleman living at Bruges who was so often and so
      long in the company of a certain pretty girl that at last he made her
      belly swell.
    </p>
    <p>
      And about the same time that he was aware of this, the Duke called
      together his men-at-arms, and our gentleman was forced to abandon his
      lady-love and go with others to serve the said lord, which he willingly
      did. But, before leaving, he provided sponsors and a nurse against the
      time his child should come into the world, and lodged the mother with good
      people to whose care he recommended her, and left money for her. And when
      he had done all this as quickly as he could, he took leave of his lady,
      and promised that, if God pleased, he would return quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may fancy if she wept when she found that he whom she loved better
      than any one in the world, was going away. She could not at first speak,
      so much did her tears oppress her heart, but at last she grew calmer when
      she saw that there was nothing else to be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      About a month after the departure of her lover, desire burned in her
      heart, and she remembered the pleasures she had formerly enjoyed, and of
      which the unfortunate absence of her friend now deprived her. The God of
      Love, who is never idle, whispered to her of the virtues and riches of a
      certain merchant, a neighbour, who many times, both before and since the
      departure of her lover, had solicited her love, so that she decided that
      if he ever returned to the charge he should not be sent away discouraged,
      and that even if she met him in the street she would behave herself in
      such a way as would let him see that she liked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened that the day after she arrived at this determination,
      Cupid sent round the merchant early in the morning to present her with
      dogs and birds and other gifts, which those who seek after women are
      always ready to present.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not rebuffed, for if he was willing to attack she was not the less
      ready to surrender, and prepared to give him even more than he dared to
      ask; for she found in him such chivalry, prowess, and virtue that she
      quite forgot her old lover, who at that time suspected nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good merchant was much pleased with his new lady, and they so loved
      each other, and their wills, desires, and thoughts so agreed, that it was
      as though they had but a single heart between them. They could not be
      content until they were living together, so one night the wench packed up
      all her belongings and went to the merchant's house, thus abandoning her
      old lover, her landlord and his wife, and a number of other good people to
      whose care she had been recommended.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not a fool, and as soon as she found herself well lodged, she told
      the merchant she was pregnant, at which he was very joyful, believing that
      he was the cause; and in about seven months the wench brought forth a fine
      boy, and the adoptive father was very fond both of the child and its
      mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain time afterwards the gentleman returned from the war, and came to
      Bruges, and as soon as he decently could, took his way to the house where
      he had left his mistress, and asked news of her from those whom he had
      charged to lodge her and clothe her, and aid her in her confinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" they said. "Do you not know? Have you not had the letters which
      were written to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, by my oath," said he. "What has happened?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holy Mary!" they replied, "you have good reason to ask. You had not been
      gone more than a month when she packed up her combs and mirrors and betook
      herself to the house of a certain merchant, who is greatly attached to
      her. And, in fact, she has there been brought to bed of a fine boy. The
      merchant has had the child christened, and believes it to be his own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John! that is something new," said the gentleman, "but, since she
      is that sort of a woman, she may go to the devil. The merchant may have
      her and keep her, but as for the child I am sure it is mine, and I want
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon he went and knocked loudly at the door of the merchant's house.
      By chance, the lady was at home and opened the door, and when she
      recognised the lover she had deserted, they were both astonished.
      Nevertheless, he asked her how she came in that place, and she replied
      that Fortune had brought her there.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fortune?" said he; "Well then, fortune may keep you; but I want my child.
      Your new master may have the cow, but I will have the calf; so give it to
      me at once, for I will have it whatever may happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said the wench, "what will my man say? I shall be disgraced, for
      he certainly believes the child is his."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't care what he thinks," replied the other, "but he shall not have
      what is mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my friend, I beg and request of you to leave the merchant this child;
      you will do him a great service and me also. And by God! you will not be
      tempted to have the child when once you have seen him, for he is an ugly,
      awkward boy, all scrofulous and mis-shapen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever he is," replied the other, "he is mine, and I will have him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't talk so loud, for God's sake!" said the wench, "and be calm, I beg!
      And if you will only leave me this child, I promise you that I will give
      you the next I have."
    </p>
    <p>
      Angry as the gentleman was, he could not help smiling at hearing these
      words, so he said no more and went away, and never again demanded the
      child, which was brought up by the merchant.

      STORY THE TWENTY-THIRD &mdash; THE LAWYER'S WIFE WHO PASSED THE LINE. <a
      href="#linklinknote-23" name="linklinknoteref-23" id="linklinknoteref-23">23</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Commesuram.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a clerk of whom his mistress was enamoured, and what he promised
        to do and did to her if she crossed a line which the said clerk had
        made. Seeing which, her little son told his father when he returned that
        he must not cross the line; or said he, "the clerk will serve you as he
        did mother."</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Formerly there lived in the town of Mons, in Hainault, a lawyer of a ripe
      old age, who had, amongst his other clerks, a good-looking and amiable
      youth, with whom the lawyer's wife fell deeply in love, for it appeared to
      her that he was much better fitted to do her business than her husband
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      She decided that she would behave in such a way that, unless he were more
      stupid than an ass, he would know what she wanted of him; and, to carry
      out her design, this lusty wench, who was young, fresh, and buxom, often
      brought her sewing to where the clerk was, and talked to him of a hundred
      thousand matters, most of them about love.
    </p>
    <p>
      And during all this talk she did not forget to practise little tricks:
      sometimes she would knock his elbow when he was writing; another time she
      threw gravel and spoiled his work, so that he was forced to write it all
      over again. Another time also she recommenced these tricks, and took away
      his paper and parchment, so that he could not work,&mdash;at which he was
      not best pleased, fearing that his master would be angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time his mistress practised these tricks, but he being young,
      and his eyes not opened, he did not at first see what she intended;
      nevertheless at last he concluded he was in her good books.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after he arrived at this conclusion, it chanced that the lawyer
      being out of the house, his wife came to the clerk to teaze him as was her
      custom, and worried him more than usual, nudging him, talking to him,
      preventing him from working, and hiding his paper, ink &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our clerk more knowing than formerly, and seeing what all this meant,
      sprang to his feet, attacked his mistress and drove her back, and begged
      of her to allow him to write&mdash;but she who asked for nothing better
      than a tussle, was not inclined to discontinue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, madam," said he, "that I must finish this writing which I
      have begun? I therefore ask of you to let me alone or, morbleu, I will pay
      you out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you do, my good lad?" said she. "Make ugly faces?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, by God!*
    </p>
    <p>
      "What then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, tell me what!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why," said he, "since you have upset my inkstand, and crumpled my
      writing, I will well crumple your parchment, and that I may not be
      prevented from writing by want of ink, I will dip into your inkstand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my soul," quoth she, "you are not the man to do it. Do you think I am
      afraid of you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does not matter what sort of man I am," said the clerk, "but if you
      worry me any more, I am man enough to make you pay for it. Look here! I
      will draw a line on the floor, and by God, if you overstep it, be it ever
      so little, I wish I may die if I do not make you pay dearly for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my word," said she, "I am not afraid of you, and I will pass the line
      and see what you will do," and so saying the merry hussy made a little
      jump which took her well over the line.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk grappled with her, and threw her down on a bench, and punished
      her well, for if she had rumpled him outside and openly, he rumpled her
      inside and secretly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that there was present at the time a young child, about
      two years old, the son of the lawyer. It need not be said either, that
      after this first passage of arms between the clerk and his mistress, there
      were many more secret encounters between them, with less talk and more
      action than on the first occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must know too that, a few days after this adventure, the little child
      was in the office where the clerk was writing, when there came in the
      lawyer, the master of the house, who walked across the room to his clerk,
      to see what he wrote, or for some other matter, and as he approached the
      line which the clerk had drawn for his wife, and which still remained on
      the floor, his little son cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Father, take care you do not cross the line, or the clerk will lay you
      down and tumble you as he did mother a few days ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawyer heard the remark, and saw the line, but knew not what to think;
      but if he remembered that fools, drunkards, and children always tell the
      truth, at all events he made no sign, and it has never come to my
      knowledge that he ever did so, either through want of confirmation of his
      suspicions, or because he feared to make a scandal.

      STORY THE TWENTY-FOURTH &mdash; HALF-BOOTED. <a href="#linklinknote-24"
      name="linklinknoteref-24" id="linklinknoteref-24">24</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Fiennes.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a Count who would ravish by force a fair, young girl who was one
        of his subjects, and how she escaped from him by means of his leggings,
        and how he overlooked her conduct and helped her to a husband, as is
        hereafter related.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I know that in many of the stories already related the names of the
      persons concerned are not stated, but I desire to give, in my little
      history, the name of Comte Valerien, who was in his time Count of St. Pol,
      and was called "the handsome Count". Amongst his other lordships, he was
      lord of a village in the district of Lille, called Vrelenchem, about a
      league distant from Lille.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentle Count, though of a good and kind nature, was very amorous. He
      learned by report from one of his retainers, who served him in these
      matters, that at the said Vrelenchem there resided a very pretty girl of
      good condition. He was not idle in these matters, and soon after he heard
      the news, he was in that village, and with his own eyes confirmed the
      report that his faithful servants had given him concerning the said
      maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The next thing to be done," said the noble Count, "is that I must speak
      to her alone, no matter what it may cost me."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of his followers, who was a doctor by profession, said, "My lord, for
      your honour and that of the maiden also, it seems to me better that I
      should make known to her your will, and you can frame your conduct
      according to the reply that I receive."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did as he said, and went to the fair maiden and saluted her
      courteously, and she, who was as wise as she was fair and good, politely
      returned his salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut matters short, after a few ordinary phrases, the worthy messenger
      preached much about the possessions and the honours of his master, and
      told her that if she liked she would be the means of enriching all her
      family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair damsel knew what o'clock it was. (*) Her reply was like herself&mdash;fair
      and good&mdash;for it was that she would obey, fear, and serve the Count
      in anything that did not concern her honour, but that she held as dear as
      her life.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) A literal translation.   La bonne fille entendit tantost
     quelle heure il estoit.
</pre>
    <p>
      The one who was astonished and vexed at this reply was our go-between, who
      returned disappointed to his master, his embassy having failed. It need
      not be said that the Count was not best pleased at hearing of this proud
      and harsh reply made by the woman he loved better than anyone in the
      world, and whose person he wished to enjoy. But he said, "Let us leave her
      alone for the present. I shall devise some plan when she thinks I have
      forgotten her."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left there soon afterwards, and did not return until six weeks had
      passed, and, when he did return it was very quietly, and he kept himself
      private, and his presence unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      He learned from his spies one day that the fair maiden was cutting grass
      at the edge of a wood, and aloof from all company; at which he was very
      joyful, and, all booted as he was, set out for the place in company with
      his spies. And when he came near to her whom he sought, he sent away his
      company, and stole close to her before she was aware of his presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was astonished and confused, and no wonder, to see the Count so close
      to her, and she turned pale and could not speak, for she knew by report
      that he was a bold and dangerous man to women.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, fair damsel," said the Count, "you are wondrous proud! One is obliged
      to lay siege to you. Now defend yourself as best you can, for there will
      be a battle between us, and, before I leave, you shall suffer by my will
      and desire, all the pains that I have suffered and endured for love of
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, my lord!" said the young girl, who was frightened and surprised. "I
      ask your mercy! If I have said or done anything that may displease you, I
      ask your pardon; though I do not think I have said or done anything for
      which you should owe me a grudge. I do not know what report was made of
      me. Dishonourable proposals were made to me in your name, but I did not
      believe them, for I deem you so virtuous that on no account would you
      dishonour one of your poor, humble subjects like me, but on the contrary
      protect her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drop this talk!" said my lord, "and be sure that you shall not escape me.
      I told you why I sent to you, and of the good I intended to do you," and
      without another word, he seized her in his arms, and threw her down on a
      heap of grass which was there, and pressed her closely, and quickly made
      all preparations to accomplish his desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl, who saw that she was on the point of losing that which she
      held most precious, bethought her of a trick, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my lord, I surrender! I will do whatever you like, and without
      refusal or contradiction, but it would be better that you should do with
      me whatever you will by my free consent, than by force and against my will
      accomplish your intent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate," said my lord, "you shall not escape me! What is it you
      want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would beg of you," said she, "to do me the honour not to dirty me with
      your leggings, which are greasy and dirty, and which you do not require."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can I do with them?" asked my lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will take them off nicely for you," said she, "if you please; for by my
      word, I have neither heart nor courage to welcome you if you wear those
      mucky leggings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The leggings do not make much difference," said my lord, "nevertheless if
      you wish it, they shall be taken off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he let go of her, and seated himself on the grass, and stretched out
      his legs, and the fair damsel took off his spurs, and then tugged at one
      of his leggings, which were very tight. And when with much difficulty she
      had got it half off, she ran away as fast as her legs could carry her with
      her will assisting, and left the noble Count, and never ceased running
      until she was in her father's house.
    </p>
    <p>

    <div class="fig" style="width:80%;">
      <img src="images/24.jpg" width="100%" alt="24.jpg" title=" Half-booted " />
    </div>
    <p>
      The worthy lord who was thus deceived was in as great a rage as he could
      be. With much trouble he got on his feet, thinking that if he stepped on
      his legging he could pull it off, but it was no good, it was too tight,
      and there was nothing for him to do but return to his servants. He did not
      go very far before he found his retainers waiting for him by the side of a
      ditch; they did not know what to think when they saw him in that disarray.
      He related his story, and they put his boots on for him, and if you had
      heard him you would have thought that she who thus deceived him was not
      long for this world, he so cursed and threatened her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But angry as he was for a time, his anger soon cooled, and was converted
      into sincere respect. Indeed he afterwards provided for her, and married
      her at his own cost and expense to a rich and good husband, on account of
      her frankness and loyalty.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Philippe De Saint-Yon.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a girl who complained of being forced by a young man, whereas she
        herself had helped him to find that which he sought;&mdash;and of the
        judgment which was given thereon.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The incident on which I found my story happened so recently that I need
      not alter, nor add to, nor suppress, the facts. There recently came to the
      provost at Quesnay, a fair wench, to complain of the force and violence
      she had suffered owing to the uncontrollable lust of a young man. The
      complaint being laid before the provost, the young man accused of this
      crime was seized, and as the common people say, was already looked upon as
      food for the gibbet, or the headsman's axe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wench, seeing and knowing that he of whom she had complained was in
      prison, greatly pestered the provost that justice might be done her,
      declaring that without her will and consent, she had by force been
      violated and dishonoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provost, who was a discreet and wise man, and very experienced in
      judicial matters, assembled together all the notables and chief men, and
      commanded the prisoner to be brought forth, and he having come before the
      persons assembled to judge him, was asked whether he would confess, by
      torture or otherwise, the horrible crime laid to his charge, and the
      provost took him aside and adjured him to tell the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is such and such a woman," said he, "who complains bitterly that you
      have forced her. Is it so? Have you forced her? Take care that you tell
      the truth, for if you do not you will die, but if you do you will be
      pardoned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my oath, provost," replied the prisoner, "I will not conceal from you
      that I have often sought her love. And, in fact, the day before yesterday,
      after a long talk together, I laid her upon the bed, to do you know what,
      and pulled up her dress, petticoat, and chemise. But my weasel could not
      find her rabbit hole, and went now here now there, until she kindly showed
      it the right road, and with her own hands pushed it in. I am sure that it
      did not come out till it had found its prey, but as to force, by my oath
      there was none."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that true?" asked the provost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, on my oath," answered the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good," said he, "we shall soon arrange matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      After these words, the provost took his seat in the pontifical chair,
      surrounded by all the notable persons; and the young man was seated on a
      small bench in front of the judges, and all the people, and of her who
      accused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      '"Now, my dear," said the provost, "what have you to say about the
      prisoner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Provost!" said she, "I complain that he has forced me and violated me
      against my will and in spite of me. Therefore I demand justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you to say in reply?" asked the provost of the prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir," he replied, "I have already told how it happened, and I do not
      think she can contradict me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear!" said the provost to the girl, "think well of what you are
      saying! You complain of being forced. It is a very serious charge! He says
      that he did not use any force, but that you consented, and indeed almost
      asked for what you got. And if he speaks truly, you yourself directed his
      weasel, which was wandering about near your rabbit-hole, and with your two
      hands&mdash;or at least with one&mdash;pushed the said weasel into your
      burrow. Which thing he could never have done without your help, and if you
      had resisted but ever so little he would never have effected his purpose.
      If his weasel was allowed to rummage in your burrow, that is not his
      fault, and he is not punishable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Provost," said the girl plaintively, "what do you mean by that? It is
      quite true, and I will not deny it, that I conducted his weasel into my
      burrow&mdash;but why did I do so? By my oath, Sir, its head was so stiff,
      and its muzzle so hard, that I was sure that it would make a large cut, or
      two or three, on my belly, if I did not make haste and put it where it
      could do little harm&mdash;and that is what I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      You may fancy what a burst of laughter there was at the end of this trial,
      both from the judges and the public. The young man was discharged,&mdash;to
      continue his rabbit-hunting if he saw fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was angry that he was not hanged on a high forked tree for having
      hung on her "low forks" (*). But this anger and resentment did not last
      long, for as I heard afterwards on good authority, peace was concluded
      between them, and the youth had the right to ferret in the coney burrow
      whenever he felt inclined.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Foquessoles.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of the loves of a young gentleman and a damsel, who tested the
        loyalty of the gentleman in a marvellous and courteous manner, and slept
        three nights with him without his knowing that it was not a man,&mdash;as
        you will more fully hear hereafter.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the duchy of Brabant&mdash;not so long ago but that the memory of it is
      fresh in the present day&mdash;happened a strange thing, which is worthy
      of being related, and is not unfit to furnish a story. And in order that
      it should be publicly known and reported, here is the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the household of a great baron of the said country there lived and
      resided a young, gracious, and kind gentleman, named Gerard, who was
      greatly in love with a damsel of the said household, named Katherine. And
      when he found opportunity, he ventured to tell her of his piteous case.
      Most people will be able to guess the answer he received, and therefore,
      to shorten matters, I omit it here.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time Gerard and Katherine loved each other so warmly that there was
      but one heart and one will between them. This loyal and perfect love
      endured no little time&mdash;indeed two years passed away. Love, who
      blinds the eyes of his disciples, had so blinded these two that they did
      not know that this affection, which they thought secret, was perceived by
      every one; there was not a man or a woman in the chateau who was not aware
      of it&mdash;in fact the matter was so noised abroad that all the talk of
      the household was of the loves of Gerard and Katherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two poor, deluded fools were so much occupied with their own affairs
      that they did not suspect their love affairs were discussed by others.
      Envious persons, or those whom it did not concern, brought this love
      affair to the knowledge of the master and mistress of the two lovers, and
      it also came to the ears of the father and mother of Katherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine was informed by a damsel belonging to the household, who was one
      of her friends and companions, that her love for Gerard had been
      discovered and revealed both to her father and mother, and also to the
      master and mistress of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, what is to be done, my dear sister and friend?" asked Katherine. "I
      am lost, now that so many persons know, or guess at, my condition. Advise
      me, or I am ruined, and the most unfortunate woman in the world," and at
      these words her eyes filled with tears, which rolled down her fair cheeks
      and even fell to the edge of her robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her friend was very vexed to see her grief, and tried to console her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My sister," she said, "it is foolish to show such great grief; for, thank
      God, no one can reproach you with anything that touches your honour or
      that of your friends. If you have listened to the vows of a gentleman,
      that is not a thing forbidden by the Court of Honour, it is even the path,
      the true road, to arrive there. You have no cause for grief, for there is
      not a soul living who can bring a charge against you. But, at any rate, I
      should advise that, to stop chattering tongues which are discussing your
      love affairs, your lover, Gerard, should, without more ado, take leave of
      our lord and lady, alleging that he is to set out on a long voyage, or
      take part in some war now going on, and, under that excuse, repair to some
      house and wait there until God and Cupid have arranged matters. He will
      keep you informed by messages how he is, and you will do the same to him;
      and by that time the rumours will have ceased, and you can communicate
      with one another by letter until better times arrive. And do not imagine
      that your love will cease&mdash;it will be as great, or greater, than
      ever, for during a long time you will only hear from each other
      occasionally, and that is one of the surest ways of preserving love."
    </p>
    <p>
      The kind and good advice of this gentle dame was followed, for as soon as
      Katherine found means to speak to her lover, Gerard, she told him how the
      secret of their love had been discovered and had come to the knowledge of
      her father and mother, and the master and mistress of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you may believe," she said, "that it did not reach that point without
      much talk on the part of those of the household and many of the
      neighbours. And since Fortune is not so friendly to us as to permit us to
      live happily as we began, but menaces us with further troubles, it is
      necessary to be fore-armed against them. Therefore, as the matter much
      concerns me, and still more you, I will tell you my opinion."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that she recounted at full length the good advice which had been
      given by her friend and companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerard, who had expected a misfortune of this kind, replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My loyal and dear mistress, I am your humble and obedient servant, and,
      except God, I love no one so dearly as you. You may command me to do
      anything that seems good to you, and whatever you order shall be joyfully
      and willingly obeyed. But, believe me, there is nothing left for me in the
      world when once I am removed from your much-wished-for presence. Alas, if
      I must leave you, I fear that the first news you will hear will be that of
      my sad and pitiful death, caused by your absence, but, be that as it may,
      you are the only living person I will obey, and I prefer rather to obey
      you and die, than live for ever and disobey you. My body is yours. Cut it,
      hack it, do what you like with it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      You may guess that Katherine was grieved and vexed at seeing her lover,
      whom she adored more than anyone in the world, thus troubled. Had it not
      been for the virtue with which God had largely endowed her, she would have
      proposed to accompany him on his travels, but she hoped for happier days,
      and refrained from making such a proposal. After a pause, she replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend you must go away, but do not forget her who has given you her
      heart. And that you may have courage in the struggle which is imposed on
      you, know that I promise you on my word that as long as I live I will
      never marry any man but you of my own free-will, provided that you are
      equally loyal and true to me, as I hope you will be. And in proof of this,
      I give you this ring, which is of gold enamelled with black tears. If by
      chance they would marry me to some one else, I will defend myself so
      stoutly that you will be pleased with me, and I will prove to you that I
      can keep my promise without flinching from it. And, lastly, I beg of you
      that wherever you may stop, you will send me news about yourself, and I
      will do the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my dear mistress," said Gerard, "I see plainly that I must leave you
      for a time. I pray to God that he will give you more joy and happiness
      than I am likely to have. You have kindly given me, though I am not worthy
      of it, a noble and honourable promise, for which I cannot sufficiently
      thank you. Still less do I deserve it, but I venture in return to make a
      similar promise, begging most humbly and with all my heart, that my vow
      may have as great a weight as if it came from a much nobler man than I.
      Adieu, dearest lady. My eyes demand their turn, and prevent my tongue from
      speaking."
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words he kissed her, and pressed her tightly to his bosom, and
      then each went away to think over his or her griefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      God knows that they wept with their eyes, their hearts, and their heads,
      but ere they showed themselves, they concealed all traces of their grief,
      and put on a semblance of cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut matters short, Gerard did so much in a few days that he obtained
      leave of absence from his master&mdash;which was not very difficult, not
      that he had committed any fault, but owing to his love affair with
      Katherine, with which her friends were not best pleased, seeing that
      Gerard was not of such a good family or so rich as she was, and could not
      expect to marry her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Gerard left, and covered such a distance in one day that he came to
      Barrois, where he found shelter in the castle of a great nobleman of the
      country; and being safely housed he soon sent news of himself to the lady,
      who was very joyful thereat, and by the same messenger wrote to tell him
      of her condition, and the goodwill she bore him, and how she would always
      be loyal to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that as soon as Gerard had left Brabant, many gentlemen,
      knights and squires, came to Katherine, desiring above all things to make
      her acquaintance, which during the time that Gerard had been there they
      had been unable to do, knowing that her heart was already occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed many of them demanded her hand in marriage of her father, and
      amongst them was one who seemed to him a very suitable match. So he called
      together many of his friends, and summoned his fair daughter, and told
      them that he was already growing old, and that one of the greatest
      pleasures he could have in the world was to see his daughter well married
      before he died. Moreover, he said to them;
    </p>
    <p>
      "A certain gentleman has asked for my daughter's hand, and he seems to me
      a suitable match. If your opinion agrees with mine, and my daughter will
      obey me, his honourable request will not be rejected."
    </p>
    <p>
      All his friends and relations approved of the proposed marriage, on
      account of the virtues, riches, and other gifts of the said gentleman. But
      when they asked the opinion of the fair Katherine, she sought to excuse
      herself, and gave several reasons for refusing, or at least postponing
      this marriage, but at last she saw that she would be in the bad books of
      her father, her mother, her relatives, friends, and her master and
      mistress, if she continued to keep her promise to her lover, Gerard.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she thought of a means by which she could satisfy her parents
      without breaking her word to her lover, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dearest lord and father, I do not wish to disobey you in anything you
      may command, but I have made a vow to God, my creator, which I must keep.
      Now I have made a resolution and sworn in my heart to God that I would
      never marry unless He would of His mercy show me that that condition was
      necessary for the salvation of my poor soul. But as I do not wish to be a
      trouble to you, I am content to accept this condition of matrimony, or any
      other that you please, if you will first give me leave to make a
      pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Nicolas at Varengeville (*) which
      pilgrimage I vowed and promised to make before I changed my present
      condition."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) A town of Lorraine, on the Meurthe, about six miles from
     Kancy. Pilgrims flocked thither from all parts to worship
     the relics of St. Nicolas.
</pre>
    <p>
      She said this in order that she might see her lover on the road, and tell
      him how she was constrained against her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father was rather pleased to hear the wise and dutiful reply of his
      daughter. He granted her request, and wished to at once order her retinue,
      and spoke to his wife about it when his daughter was present.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will give her such and such gentlemen, who with Ysabeau, Marguerite
      and Jehanneton, will be sufficient for her condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my lord," said Katherine, "if it so please you we will order it
      otherwise. You know that the road from here to St. Nicolas is not very
      safe, and that when women are to be escorted great precautions must be
      taken. I could not go thus without great expense; moreover, the road is
      long, and if it happened that we lost either our goods or honour (which
      may God forfend) it would be a great misfortune. Therefore it seems good
      to me&mdash;subject to your good pleasure&mdash;that there should be made
      for me a man's dress and that I should be escorted by my uncle, the
      bastard, each mounted on a stout horse. We should go much quicker, more
      safely, and with less expense, and I should have more confidence than with
      a large retinue."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good lord, having thought over the matter a little while, spoke about
      it to his wife, and it seemed to them that the proposal showed much common
      sense and dutiful feeling. So everything was prepared for their departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      They set out on their journey, the fair Katherine and her uncle, the
      bastard, without any other companion. Katherine, who was dressed in the
      German fashion very elegantly, was the master, and her uncle, the bastard,
      was the serving man. They made such haste that their pilgrimage was soon
      accomplished, as far as St. Nicolas was concerned, and, as they were on
      their return journey-praising God for having preserved them, and talking
      over various matters Katherine said to her uncle,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Uncle, you know that I am sole heiress to my father, and that I could
      bestow many benefits upon you, which I will most willingly do if you will
      aid me in a small quest I am about to undertake&mdash;that is to go to the
      castle of a certain lord of Barrois (whom she named) to see Gerard, whom
      you know. And, in order that when we return we may have some news to tell,
      we will demand hospitality, and if we obtain it we will stop there for
      some days and see the country, and you need be under no fear but that I
      shall take care of my honour, as a good girl should."
    </p>
    <p>
      The uncle, who hoped to be rewarded some day, and knew she was virtuous,
      vowed to himself that he would keep an eye upon her, and promised to serve
      her and accompany her wherever she wished. He was much thanked no doubt,
      and it was then decided that he should call his niece, Conrad.
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon came, as they desired, to the wished-for place, and addressed
      themselves to the lord's major-domo, who was an old knight, and who
      received them most joyfully and most honourably.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conrad asked him if the lord, his master, did not wish to have in his
      service a young gentleman who was fond of adventures, and desirous of
      seeing various countries?
    </p>
    <p>
      The major-domo asked him whence he came, and he replied, from Brabant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then," said the major-domo, "you shall dine here, and after dinner I
      will speak to my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he had them conducted to a fair chamber, and ordered the table
      to be laid, and a good fire to be lighted, and sent them soup and a piece
      of mutton, and white wine while dinner was preparing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went to his master and told him of the arrival of a young
      gentleman of Brabant, who wished to serve him, and the lord was content to
      take the youth if he wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut matters short, as soon as he had served his master, he returned to
      Conrad to dine with him, and brought with him, because he was of Brabant,
      the aforesaid Gerard, and said to Conrad;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is a young gentleman who belongs to your country."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad to meet him," said Conrad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you are very welcome," replied Gerard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not recognise his lady-love, though she knew him very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst they were making each other's acquaintance, the meat was brought
      in, and each took his place on either hand of the major-domo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner seemed long to Conrad, who hoped afterwards to have some
      conversation with her lover, and expected also that she would soon be
      recognised either by her voice, or by the replies she made to questions
      concerning Brabant; but it happened quite otherwise, for during all the
      dinner, the worthy Gerard did not ask after either man or woman in all
      Brabant; which Conrad could not at all understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner passed, and after dinner my lord engaged Conrad in his service; and
      the major-domo, who was a thoughtful, experienced man, gave instructions
      that as Gerard and Conrad came from the same place, they should share the
      same chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this Gerard and Conrad went off arm in arm to look at their horses,
      but as far as Gerard was concerned, if he talked about anything it was not
      Brabant. Poor Conrad&mdash;that is to say the fair Katherine&mdash;began
      to suspect that she was like forgotten sins, and had gone clean out of
      Gerard's mind; but she could not imagine why, at least, he did not ask
      about the lord and lady with whom she lived. The poor girl was, though she
      could not show it, in great distress of mind, and did not know what to do;
      whether to still conceal her identity, and test him by some cunning
      phrases, or to suddenly make herself known.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end she decided that she would still remain Conrad, and say nothing
      about Katherine unless Gerard should alter his manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening passed as the dinner had done, and when they came to their
      chamber, Gerard and Conrad spoke of many things, but not of the one
      subject pleasing to the said Conrad. When he saw that the other only
      replied in the words that were put into his mouth, she asked of what
      family he was in Brabant, and why he left there, and where he was when he
      was there, and he replied as it seemed good to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And do you not know," she said, "such and such a lord, and such another?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John, yes!" he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, she named the lord at whose castle she had lived; and he replied
      that he knew him well, but not saying that he had lived there, or ever
      been there in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is rumoured," she said, "there are some pretty girls there. Do you
      know of any?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know very little," he replied, "and care less. Leave me alone; for I am
      dying to go to sleep!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" she said. "Can you sleep when pretty girls are being talked about?
      That is a sign that you are not in love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not reply, but slept like a pig, and poor Katherine began to have
      serious doubts about him, but she resolved to try him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the morrow came, each dressed himself, talking and chattering
      meanwhile of what each liked best&mdash;Gerard of dogs and hawks, and
      Conrad of the pretty girls of that place and Brabant.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, Conrad managed to separate Gerard from the others, and told
      him that the country of Barrois was very flat and ugly, but Brabant was
      quite different, and let him know that he (Conrad) longed to return
      thither.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what purpose?" asked Gerard. "What do you see in Brabant that is not
      here? Have you not here fine forests for hunting, good rivers, and plains
      as pleasant as could be wished for flying falcons, and plenty of game of
      all sorts?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Still that is nothing!" said Conrad. "The women of Brabant are very
      different, and they please me much more than any amount of hunting or
      hawking!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John! they are quite another affair," said Gerard. "You are
      exceedingly amorous in your Brabant, I dare swear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath!" said Conrad, "it is not a thing that can be hidden, for I
      myself am madly in love. In fact my heart is drawn so forcibly that I fear
      I shall be forced to quit your Barrois, for it will not be possible for me
      to live long without seeing my lady love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then it was a madness," said Gerard, "to have left her, if you felt
      yourself so inconstant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Inconstant, my friend! Where is the man who can guarantee that he will be
      constant in love. No one is so wise or cautious that he knows for certain
      how to conduct himself. Love often drives both sense and reason out of his
      followers."
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation dropped as supper time came, and was not renewed till
      they were in bed. Gerard would have desired nothing better than to go to
      sleep, but Conrad renewed the discussion, and began a piteous, long, and
      sad complaint about his ladylove (which, to shorten matters, I omit) and
      at last he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, Gerard, and how can you desire to sleep whilst I am so wide awake,
      and my soul is filled with cares, and regrets, and troubles. It is strange
      that you are not a little touched yourself, for, believe me, if it were a
      contagious disease you could not be so close to me and escape unscathed. I
      beg of you, though you do not feel yourself, to have some pity and
      compassion on me, for I shall die soon if I do not behold my lady-love."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never saw such a love-sick fool!" cried Gerard. "Do you think that I
      have never been in love? I know what it is, for I have passed through it
      the same as you&mdash;certainly I have! But I was never so love-mad as to
      lose my sleep or upset myself, as you are doing now. You are an idiot, and
      your love is not worth a doit. Besides do you think your lady is the same
      as you are? No, no!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure she is," replied Conrad; "she is so true-hearted."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you speak as you wish," said Gerard, "but I do not believe that women
      are so true as to always remain faithful to their vows; and those who
      believe in them are blockheads. Like you, I have loved, and still love.
      For, to tell you the truth, I left Brabant on account of a love affair,
      and when I left I was high in the graces of a very beautiful, good, and
      noble damsel, whom I quitted with much regret; and for no small time I was
      in great grief at not being able to see her&mdash;though I did not cease
      to sleep, drink, or eat, as you do. When I found that I was no longer able
      to see her, I cured myself by following Ovid's advice, for I had not been
      here long before I made the acquaintance of a pretty girl in the house,
      and so managed, that&mdash;thank God&mdash;she now likes me very much, and
      I love her. So that now I have forgotten the one I formerly loved, and
      only care for the one I now possess, who has turned my thoughts from my
      old love!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" cried Conrad. "Is it possible that, if you really loved the other,
      you can so soon forget her and desert her? I cannot understand nor imagine
      how that can be!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is so, nevertheless, whether you understand it or not." "That is not
      keeping faith loyally," said Conrad. "As for me, I would rather die a
      thousand times, if that were possible, than be so false to my lady.
      However long God may let me live, I shall never have the will, or even the
      lightest thought, of ever loving any but her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the greater fool you," said Gerard, "and if you persevere in this
      folly, you will never be of any good, and will do nothing but dream and
      muse; and you will dry up like the green herb that is cast into the
      furnace, and kill yourself, and never have known any pleasure, and even
      your mistress will laugh at you,&mdash;if you are lucky enough to be
      remembered by her at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" said Conrad. "You are very experienced in love affairs. I would
      beg of you to be my intermediary, here or elsewhere, and introduce me to
      some damsel that I may be cured like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you what I will do," said Gerard. "Tomorrow I will speak to
      my mistress and tell her that we are comrades, and ask her to speak to one
      of her lady friends, who will undertake your business, and I do not doubt
      but that, if you like, you will have a good time, and that the melancholy
      which now bears you down will disappear&mdash;if you care to get rid of
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it were not for breaking my vow to my mistress, I should desire
      nothing better," said Conrad, "but at any rate I will try it."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that Gerard turned over and went to sleep, but Katherine was so
      stricken with grief at seeing and hearing the falsehood of him whom she
      loved more than all the world, that she wished herself dead and more than
      dead. Nevertheless, she put aside all feminine feeling, and assumed manly
      vigour. She even had the strength of mind to talk for a long time the next
      day with the girl who loved the man <i>she</i> had once adored; and even
      compelled her heart and eyes to be witnesses of many interviews and love
      passages that were most galling to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst she was talking to Gerard's mistress, she saw the ring that she had
      given her unfaithful lover, but she was not so foolish as to admire it,
      but nevertheless found an opportunity to examine it closely on the girl's
      finger, but appeared to pay no heed to it, and soon afterwards left.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as supper was over, she went to her uncle, and said to him;
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have been long enough in Barrois! It is time to leave. Be ready
      to-morrow morning at daybreak, and I will be also. And take care that all
      our baggage is prepared. Come for me as early as you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have but to come down when you will," replied the uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that after supper, whilst Gerard was conversing with his
      mistress, she who had been his lady-love went to her chamber and began to
      write a letter, which narrated at full length the love affairs of herself
      and Gerard, also "the promises which they made at parting, how they had
      wished to marry her to another and how she had refused, and the pilgrimage
      that she had undertaken to keep her word and come to him, and the
      disloyalty and falsehood she had found in him, in word, act, and deed. And
      that, for the causes mentioned, she held herself free and disengaged from
      the promise she had formerly made. And that she was going to return to her
      own country and never wished to see him or meet him again, he being the
      falsest man who ever made vows to a woman. And as regards the ring that
      she had given him, that he had forfeited it by passing it into the hands
      of a third person. And if he could boast that he had lain three nights by
      her side, there was no harm, and he might say what he liked, and she was
      not afraid."
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Letter written by a hand you ought to know</i>, and underneath <i>Katherine
      etc., otherwise known as Conrad</i>; and on the back, <i>To the false
      Gerard</i> etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      She scarcely slept all night, and as soon as she saw the dawn, she rose
      gently and dressed herself without awaking Gerard. She took the letter,
      which she had folded and sealed, and placed it in the sleeve of Gerard's
      jerkin; then in a vow voice prayed to God for him, and wept gently on
      account of the grief she endured on account of the falseness she had met
      with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerard still slept, and did not reply a word. Then she went to her uncle,
      who gave her her horse which she mounted, and they left the country, and
      soon came to Brabant, where they were joyfully received, God knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may imagine that all sorts of questions were asked about their
      adventures and travels, and how they had managed, but whatever they
      replied they took care to say nothing about their principal adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to Gerard. He awoke about 10 o'clock on the morning of the
      day when Katherine left, and looked to see if his companion Conrad was
      already risen. He did not know it was so late, and jumped out of bed in
      haste to seek for his jerkin. When he put his arm in the sleeve, out
      dropped the letter, at which he was much astonished, for he did not
      remember putting it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      At any rate, he picked it up, and saw that it was sealed, and had written
      on the back, <i>To the false Gerard</i>. If he had been astonished before,
      he was still more so now.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a little while he opened it and saw the signature, <i>Katherine
      known as Conrad</i> etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know what to think, nevertheless he read the letter, and in
      reading it the blood mounted to his cheeks, and his heart sank within him,
      so that he was quite changed both in looks and complexion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He finished reading the letter the best way he could, and learned that his
      falseness had come to the knowledge of her who wished so well to him, and
      that she knew him to be what he was, not by the report of another person,
      but by her own eyes; and what touched him most to the heart was that he
      had lain three nights with her without having thanked her for the trouble
      she had taken to come so far to make trial of his love.
    </p>
    <p>
      He champed the bit, and was wild with rage, when he saw how he had been
      mystified. After much thought, he resolved that the best thing to do was
      to follow her, as he thought he might overtake her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took leave of his master and set out, and followed the trail of their
      horses, but did not catch them up before they came to Brabant, where he
      arrived opportunely on the day of the marriage of the woman who had tested
      his affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished to kiss her and salute her, and make some poor excuse for his
      fault, but he was not able to do so, for she turned her back on him, and
      he could not, all the time that he was there, find an opportunity of
      talking with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once he advanced to lead her to the dance, but she flatly refused in the
      face of all the company, many of whom took note of the incident. For, not
      long after, another gentleman entered, and caused the minstrels to strike
      up, and advanced towards her, and she came down and danced with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, as you have heard, did the false lover lose his mistress. If there
      are others like him, let them take warning by this example, which is
      perfectly true, and is well known, and happened not so very long ago.

      STORY THE TWENTY-SEVENTH &mdash; THE HUSBAND IN THE CLOTHES-CHEST. <a
      href="#linklinknote-27" name="linklinknoteref-27" id="linklinknoteref-27">27</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Beauvoir.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a great lord of this kingdom and a married lady, who in order that
        she might be with her lover caused her husband to be shut in a
        clothes-chest by her waiting women, and kept him there all the night,
        whilst she passed the time with her lover; and of the wagers made
        between her and the said husband, as you will find afterwards recorded.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It is not an unusual thing, especially in this country, for fair dames and
      damsels to often and willingly keep company with young gentlemen, and the
      pleasant joyful games they have together, and the kind requests which are
      made, are not difficult to guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long ago, there was a most noble lord, who might be reckoned as one of
      the princes, but whose name shall not issue from my pen, who was much in
      the good graces of a damsel who was married, and of whom report spoke so
      highly that the greatest personage in the kingdom might have deemed
      himself lucky to be her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would have liked to prove to him how greatly she esteemed him, but it
      was not easy; there were so many adversaries and enemies to be outwitted.
      And what more especially annoyed her was her worthy husband, who kept to
      the house and played the part of the cursed Dangier, (*) and the lover
      could not find any honourable excuse to make him leave.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) Allegorical personage typifying jealousy, taken from <i>Le
     Romaunt de la Rose</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      As you may imagine, the lover was greatly dissatisfied at having to wait
      so long, for he desired the fair quarry, the object of his long chase,
      more than he had ever desired anybody in all his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this cause he continued to importune his mistress, till she said to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite as displeased as you can be that I can give you no better
      welcome; but, you know, as long as my husband is in the house he must be
      considered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said he, "cannot you find any method to abridge my hard and cruel
      martyrdom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She&mdash;who as has been said above, was quite as desirous of being with
      her lover as he was with her&mdash;replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to-night, at such and such an hour, and knock at my chamber door. I
      will let you in, and will find some method to be freed from my husband, if
      Fortune does not upset our plans."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lover had never heard anything which pleased him better, and after
      many gracious thanks,&mdash;which he was no bad hand at making&mdash;he
      left her, and awaited the hour assigned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that a good hour or more before the appointed time, our
      gentle damsel, with her women and her husband, had withdrawn to her
      chamber after supper; nor was her imagination idle, but she studied with
      all her mind how she could keep her promise to her lover. Now she thought
      of one means, now of another, but nothing occurred to her by which she
      could get rid of her cursed husband; and all the time the wished-for hour
      was fast approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst she was thus buried in thought, Fortune was kind enough to do her a
      good turn, and her husband a bad one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking round the chamber, and by chance he saw at the foot of the
      bed his wife's clothes-chest. In order to make her speak, and arouse her
      from her reverie, he asked what that chest was used for, and why they did
      not take it to the wardrobe, or some other place where it would be more
      suitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no need, Monseigneur," said Madame; "no one comes here but us. I
      left it here on purpose, because there are still some gowns in it, but if
      you are not pleased, my dear, my women will soon take it away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not pleased?" said he. "No, I am not; but I like it as much here as
      anywhere else, since it pleases you; but it seems to me much too small to
      hold your gowns well without crumpling them, seeing what great and long
      trains are worn now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my word, sir," said she, "it is big enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It hardly seems so," replied he, "really; and I have looked at it well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir," said she, "will you make a bet with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly I will," he answered; "what shall it be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will bet, if you like, half a dozen of the best shirts against the
      satin to make a plain petticoat, that we can put you inside the box just
      as you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my soul," said he, "I will bet I cannot get in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I will bet you can."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on!" said the women. "We will soon see who is the winner."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will soon be proved," said Monsieur, and then he made them take out of
      the chest all the gowns which were in it, and when it was empty, Madam and
      her women put in Monsieur easily enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was much chattering, and discussion, and laughter, and Madam
      said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir; you have lost your wager! You own that, do you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said he, "you are right."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he said these words, the chest was locked, and the girls all laughing,
      playing, and dancing, carried both chest and man together, and put it in a
      big cupboard some distance away from the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cried, and struggled, and made a great noise; but it was no good, and
      he was left there all the night. He could sleep, or think, or do the best
      he could, but Madam had given secret instructions that he was not to be
      let out that day, because she had been too much bothered by him already.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to return to the tale we had begun. We will leave our man in his
      chest, and talk about Madam, who was awaiting her lover, surrounded by her
      waiting women, who were so good and discreet that they never revealed any
      secrets. They knew well enough that the dearly beloved adorer was to
      occupy that night the place of the man who was doing penance in the
      clothes-chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not wait long before the lover, without making any noise or
      scare, knocked at the chamber door, and they knew his knock, and quickly
      let him in. He was joyfully received and kindly entertained by Madam and
      her maids; and he was glad to find himself alone with his lady love, who
      told him what good fortune God had given her, that is to say how she had
      made a bet with her husband that he could get into the chest, how he had
      got in, and how she and her women had carried him away to a cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said her lover. "I cannot believe that he is in the house. By my
      word, I believed that you had found some excuse to send him out whilst I
      took his place with you for a time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need not go," she said. "He cannot get out of where he is. He may cry
      as much as he will, but there is no one here likes him well enough to let
      him out, and there he will stay; but if you would like to have him set
      free, you have but to say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Our Lady," said he, "if he does not come out till I let him out, he
      will wait a good long time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then, let us enjoy ourselves," said she, "and think no more about
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut matters short, they both undressed, and the two lovers lay down in
      the fair bed, and did what they intended to do, and which is better
      imagined than described.
    </p>
    <p>
      When day dawned, her paramour took leave of her as secretly as he could,
      and returned to his lodgings to sleep, I hope, and to breakfast, for he
      had need of both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madam, who was as cunning as she was wise and good, rose at the usual
      hour, and said to her women;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will soon be time to let out our prisoner. I will go and see what he
      says, and whether he will pay his ransom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put all the blame on us," they said. "We will appease him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, I will do so," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words she made the sign of the Cross, and went nonchalantly, as
      though not thinking what she was doing, into the cupboard where her
      husband was still shut up in the chest. And when he heard her he began to
      make a great noise and cry out, "Who is there? Why do you leave me locked
      up here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His good wife, who heard the noise he was making replied timidly, as
      though frightened, and playing the simpleton;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heavens! who is it that I hear crying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is I! It is I!" cried the husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You?" she cried; "and where do you come from at this time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whence do I come?" said he. "You know very well, madam. There is no need
      for me to tell you&mdash;but what you did to me I will some day do to
      you,"&mdash;for he was so angry that he would willingly have showered
      abuse upon his wife, but she cut him short, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, for God's sake pardon me. On my oath I assure you that I did not
      know you were here now, for, believe me, I am very much astonished that
      you should be still here, for I ordered my women to let you out whilst I
      was at prayers, and they told me they would do so; and, in fact, one of
      them told me that you had been let out, and had gone into the town, and
      would not return home, and so I went to bed soon afterwards without
      waiting for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Saint John!" said he; "you see how it is. But make haste and let me out,
      for I am so exhausted that I can stand it no longer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That may well be," said she, "but you will not come out till you have
      promised to pay me the wager you lost, and also pardon me, or otherwise I
      will not let you out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Make haste, for God's sake! I will pay you&mdash;really."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you promise?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes&mdash;on my oath!"
    </p>
    <p>
      This arrangement being concluded, Madam opened the chest, and Monsieur
      came out, tired, cramped, and exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She took him by the arm, and kissed him, and embraced him as gently as
      could be, praying to God that he would not be angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor blockhead said that he was not angry with her, because she knew
      nothing about it, but that he would certainly punish her women.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath, sir," said she, "they are well revenged upon you&mdash;for I
      expect you have done something to them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I certainly, that I know of&mdash;but at any rate the trick they have
      played me will cost them dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had hardly finished this speech, when all the women came into the room,
      and laughed so loudly and so heartily that they could not say a word for a
      long time; and Monsieur, who was going to do such wonders, when he saw
      them laugh to such a degree, had not the heart to interfere with them.
      Madame, to keep him company, did not fail to laugh also. There was a
      marvellous amount of laughing, and he who had the least cause to laugh,
      laughed one of the loudest.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a certain time, this amusement ceased, and Monsieur said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mesdames, I thank you much for the kindness you have done me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are quite welcome, sir," said one of the women, "and still we are not
      quits. You have given us so much trouble, and caused as so much mischief,
      that we owed you a grudge, and if we have any regret it is that you did
      not remain in the box longer. And, in fact, if it had not been for Madame
      you would still be there;&mdash;so you may take it how you will!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so?" said he. "Well, well, you shall see how I will take it. By
      my oath I am well treated, when, after all I have suffered, I am only
      laughed, at, and what is still worse, must pay for the satin for the
      petticoat. Really, I ought to have the shirts that were bet, as a
      compensation for what I have suffered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven, he is right," said the women. "We are on your side as to that,
      and you shall have them. Shall he not have them, Madame?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On what grounds?" said she. "He lost the wager."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, we know that well enough: he has no right to them,&mdash;indeed
      he does not ask for them on that account, but he has well deserved them
      for another reason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind about that," said Madame. "I will willingly give the material
      out of love for you, mesdames, who have so warmly pleaded for him, if you
      will undertake to do the sewing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, truly, Madame."
    </p>
    <p>
      Like one who when he wakes in the morning has but to give himself a shake
      and he is ready, Monsieur needed but a bunch of twigs to beat his clothes
      and he was ready, and so he went to Mass; and Madame and her women
      followed him, laughing loudly at him I can assure you.
    </p>
    <p>
      And you may imagine that during the Mass there was more than one giggle
      when they remembered that Monsieur, whilst he was in the chest (though he
      did not know it himself) had been registered in the book which has no
      name. (*) And unless by chance this book falls into his hands, he will
      never,&mdash;please God&mdash;know of his misfortune, which on no account
      would I have him know. So I beg of any reader who may know him, to take
      care not to show it to him.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Messire Miohaut De Changy.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of the meeting assigned to a great Prince of this kingdom by a damsel
        who was chamber-woman to the Queen; of the little feats of arms of the
        said Prince and of the neat replies made by the said damsel to the Queen
        concerning her greyhound which had been purposely shut out of the room
        of the said Queen, as you shall shortly hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      If in the time of the most renowned and eloquent Boccaccio, the adventure
      which forms the subject of my tale had come to his knowledge, I do not
      doubt but that he would have added it to his stories of great men who met
      with bad fortune. For I think that no nobleman ever had a greater
      misfortune to bear than the good lord (whom may God pardon!) whose
      adventure I will relate, and whether his ill fortune is worthy to be in
      the aforesaid books of Boccaccio, I leave those who hear it to judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good lord of whom I speak was, in his time, one of the great princes
      of this kingdom, apparelled and furnished with all that befits a nobleman;
      and amongst his other qualities was this,&mdash;that never was man more
      destined to be a favourite with the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened to him at the time when his fame in this respect most
      flourished, and everybody was talking about him, that Cupid, who casts his
      darts wherever he likes, caused him to be smitten by the charms of a
      beautiful, young, gentle and gracious damsel, who also had made a
      reputation second to no other of that day on account of her great and
      unequalled beauty and her good manners and virtues, and who, moreover, was
      such a favourite with the Queen of that country that she shared the royal
      bed on the nights when the said Queen did not sleep with the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      This love affair, I must tell you, had advanced to such a point that each
      only desired time and place to say and do what would most please both.
      They were many days considering how to find a convenient opportunity, and
      at last, she&mdash;who was as anxious for the welfare of her lover as she
      was for the safety of her own reputation&mdash;thought of a good plan, of
      which she hastened to inform him, saying as follows;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dearest friend, you know that I sleep with the Queen, and that it is
      not possible for me&mdash;unless I would spoil everything&mdash;to resign
      that honour and position which the noblest lady of the land would think
      herself proud and happy to obtain. So that, though I would like to please
      you and do your pleasure, I would remain on good terms with her, and not
      desert her who can and does give me all the advancement and honour in the
      world. I do not suppose that you would have me act otherwise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, by my soul, dearest," replied the worthy lord; "but at any rate I
      would beg you that in serving your mistress your devoted lover should not
      be forgotten, and that you do for him all that lies in your power, for he
      would rather gain your love and good-will than aught else in the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is what I will do for you, Monseigneur," said she. "The Queen, as
      you know, has a greyhound of which she is very fond, that sleeps in her
      chamber. I will find means to shut it out of the room without her
      knowledge, and when everybody has retired, I will jump out of bed, run to
      the reception room, and unbolt the door. Then, when you think that the
      Queen is in bed, you must come quietly, and enter the reception room and
      close the door after you. There you will find the greyhound, who knows you
      well enough, and will let you approach it; pull its ears and make it cry
      out, and when the Queen hears that, I expect that she will make me get out
      of bed at once to let it in. Then I will come to you, and fail me not, if
      ever you would speak to me again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My most dear and loyal sweetheart," said Monseigneur, "I thank you all I
      can. Be sure that I will fail not to be there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he rose and went away, and the lady also; each thinking and desiring
      how to carry out the proposed plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      What need of a long story? The greyhound wanted to come into the chamber
      of his mistress at the usual time, as it had been accustomed, but the
      damsel had condemned it to banishment, and it was quickly made to beat a
      retreat. The Queen went to bed without noticing the absence of the dog,
      and soon afterwards there came to keep her company, the gentle damsel, who
      was only waiting to hear the greyhound cry out as the signal for the
      battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before the worthy lord set to work, and soon managed to
      reach the chamber where the greyhound was sleeping. He felt for it, with
      his foot or with his hand, until he found it, then he took it by the ears
      and made it cry aloud two or three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen, who heard it, soon knew that it was her greyhound, and thought
      that it wanted to come in. She called the damsel, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, my greyhound is howling outside. Get up, and let it in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willingly, madam," said the damsel, and as she awaited the battle, the
      day and hour of which she had herself appointed, she only armed herself
      with her chemise, and in that guise, came to the door and opened it, and
      soon met with him who was awaiting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so delighted and so surprised to see his ladylove so beautiful, and
      so well-prepared for the encounter, that he lost his strength and sense,
      and had not force enough left to draw his dagger, and try whether it could
      penetrate her cuirass. Of kissing, and cuddling, and playing with her
      breasts, he could do plenty; but for the grand operation&mdash;nihil.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the fair damsel was forced to return without leaving him that which he
      could not gain by force of arms. But when she would quit him, he tried to
      detain her by force and by soft speeches, but she dared not stay, so she
      shut the door in his face, and came back to the Queen, who asked her if
      she had let the greyhound in? And she said, "No, because she could not
      find it though she had looked well for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well" said the Queen, "go to bed. It will be all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor lover was very dissatisfied with himself, and thought himself
      dishonoured and disgraced, for he had up till then had such confidence in
      himself that he believed he could in less than one hour have tackled three
      ladies, and come off every time with honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last his courage returned, and he said to himself that if he ever were
      so fortunate as to find another such opportunity with his sweetheart, she
      should not escape as she did the previous time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus animated and spurred on by shame and desire, he again took the
      greyhound by the ears, and made it cry out much louder than it had before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Awakened by this cry, the Queen again sent her damsel, who opened the door
      as before, but had to return to her mistress without getting any more
      pleasure than she had the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      A third time did the poor gentleman do all in his power to tumble her, but
      the devil a bit could he find a lance to encounter her with, though she
      awaited his onslaught with a firm foot. And when she saw that she could
      not have her basket pierced, and that he could not lay his lance in rest,
      whatever advantage she gave him, she knew that the joust had come to
      nothing, and had a very poor opinion of the jouster.
    </p>
    <p>
      She would no longer stay with him for all that he could say or do. She
      wished to return to the chamber, but her lover held her by force and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, sweetheart, stay a little longer, I pray!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I cannot," she said: "let me go! I have stayed too long already,
      considering the little I got by it," and with that she turned towards the
      chamber, but he followed her and tried to detain her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw that&mdash;to pay him out, and also hoodwink the Queen&mdash;she
      called out loud,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get out! get out! dirty beast that you are! By God! you shall not come in
      here, dirty beast that you are!" and so saying she closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen, who heard it, asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      "To whom are you speaking, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To this dirty dog, madam, who has given me such trouble to look for him.
      He was lying quite flat, and with his nose on the ground, hidden under a
      bench, so that I could not find him. And when I did find him he would not
      get up for anything that I could do. I would willingly have put him in,
      but he would not deign to lift up his head, so, in disgust, I have shut
      the door upon him and left him outside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did quite right, my dear," said the Queen. "Come to bed, and go to
      sleep!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, as you have heard, was the bad luck of this noble lord; and since he
      could not when his lady would, I believe that since then, when he had the
      power, his lady's will was not to be had.

      STORY THE TWENTY-NINTH &mdash; THE COW AND THE CALF.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a gentleman to whom&mdash;the first night that he was married, and
        after he had but tried one stroke&mdash;his wife brought forth a child,
        and of the manner in which he took it,&mdash;and of the speech that he
        made to his companions when they brought him the caudle, as you shall
        shortly hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It is not a hundred years ago since a young gentleman of this country
      wished to know and experience the joys of matrimony, and&mdash;to cut
      matters short&mdash;the much-desired day of his marriage duly came.
    </p>
    <p>
      After much good cheer and the usual amusements, the bride was put to bed,
      and a short time afterwards her husband followed, and lay close to her,
      and without delay duly began the assault on her fortress. With some
      trouble he entered in and gained the stronghold, but you must understand
      that he did not complete the conquest without accomplishing many feats of
      arms which it would take long to enumerate; for before he came to the
      donjon of the castle he had other outworks, with which it was provided, to
      carry, like a place that had never been taken or was still quite new, and
      which nature had provided with many defences.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was master of the place, he broke his lance, and ceased the
      assault. But the fair damsel when she saw herself at the mercy of her
      husband, and how he had foraged the greater part of her manor, wished to
      show him a prisoner whom she held confined in a secret place,&mdash;or to
      speak plainly she was delivered on the spot, after this first encounter,
      of a fine boy; at which her husband was so ashamed and so astonished that
      he did not know what to do except to hold his tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of kindness and pity, he did all that he possibly could for both
      mother and child, but, as you may believe, the poor woman could not
      restrain from uttering a loud cry when the child was born. Many persons
      heard this cry, and believed that it was "the cry of the maidenhead," (*)
      which is a custom of this country.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) A singular custom which obliged the bride to utter a
     loud cry when she lost her virginity, and to which the
     groomsmen replied by bringing a large bowl of caudle or some
     invigorating drink into the bed chamber. From some verses
     written by Clement Marot on the marriage of the Duke of
     Ferrara to Princess Rénée, it would appear that the custom
     existed at the Court of France.
</pre>
    <p>
      Immediately all the gentlemen in the house where the bridegroom resided,
      came and knocked at the door of the chamber, and brought the caudle; but
      though they knocked loudly they received no reply, for the bride was in a
      condition in which silence is excusable, and the bridegroom had not much
      to chatter about.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter?" cried the guests. "Why do you not open the door? If
      you do not make haste we will break it open; the caudle we have brought
      you will be quite cold;" and they began to knock louder than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the bridegroom would not have uttered a word for a hundred francs; at
      which those outside did not know what to think, for he was not ordinarily
      a silent man. At last he rose, and put on a dressing-gown he had, and let
      in his friends, who soon asked him whether the caudle had been earned, and
      what sort of a time he had had? Then one of them laid the table-cloth, and
      spread the banquet, for they had everything prepared, and spared nothing
      in such cases. They all sat round to eat, and the bridegroom took his seat
      in a high-backed chair placed near his bed, looking very stupid and
      pitiful as you may imagine. And whatever the others said, he did not
      answer a word, but sat there like a statue or a carved idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter?" cried one. "You take no notice of the excellent
      repast that our host has provided. You have not said a single word yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry!" said another, "he has no jokes ready."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my soul!" said another, "marriage has wondrous properties. He has but
      been married an hour and he has lost his tongue. If he goes on at that
      rate there will soon be nothing left of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      To tell the truth, he had formerly been known as a merry fellow, fond of a
      joke, and never uttered a word but a jest; but now he was utterly cast
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentlemen drank to the bride and bridegroom, but devil a drop would
      either of them quaff in return; the one was in a violent rage, and the
      other was far from being at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not experienced in these affairs," said a gentleman, "but it seems
      we must feast by ourselves. I never saw a man with such a grim-looking
      face, and so soon sobered by a woman. You might hear a pin drop in his
      company. Marry! his loud jests are small enough now!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I drink to the bridegroom," said another, but the bridegroom neither
      drank, eat, laughed, or spoke. Nevertheless, after some time that he had
      been both scolded and teased by his friends, like a wild boar at bay, he
      retorted;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen, I have listened for some time to your jokes and reproofs. I
      would like you to understand that I have good reason to reflect and keep
      silent, and I am sure that there is no one here but would do the same if
      he had the same reasons that I have. By heavens! if I were as rich as the
      King of France, or the Duke of Burgundy, or all the princes of
      Christendom, I should not be able to provide that which, apparently, I
      shall <i>have</i> to provide. I have but touched my wife once, and she has
      brought forth a child! Now if each time that I begin again she does the
      same, how shall I be able to keep my family?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? a child?" said his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes! Really a child! Look here!" and he turned towards the bed and
      lifted up the clothes and showed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" said he. "There is the cow and the calf! Am I not well swindled?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of his friends were much astonished, and quite excused their host's
      conduct, and went away each to his own home. And the poor bridegroom
      abandoned his newly-delivered bride the first night, fearing that she
      would do the same another time, and not knowing what would become of him
      if so.

      STORY THE THIRTIETH &mdash; THE THREE CORDELIERS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monsigneur de Beauvoir
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Of three merchants of Savoy who went on a pilgrimage to St. Anthony in
        Bienne, (*) and who were deceived and cuckolded by three Cordeliers who
        slept with their wives. And how the women thought they had been with
        their husbands, and how their husbands came to know of it, and of the
        steps they took, as you shall shortly hear.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) This according to M. Lacroix is the old town of La Mothe
     St. Didier in Dauphiné, which took the name of Saint Antoine
     on account of the relics of the Saint, which were brought
     there in the 11th century.
</pre>
    <p>
      It is as true as the Gospel, that three worthy merchants of Savoy set out
      with their wives to go on a pilgrimage to St. Anthony of Vienne. And in
      order to render their journey more devout and more agreeable to God and
      St. Anthony, they determined that from the time they left their houses,
      and all through the journey, they would not sleep with their wives, but
      live in continence, both going and returning.
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived one night in the town, where they found good lodgings, and
      had excellent cheer at supper, like those who have plenty of money and
      know well what to do with it, and enjoyed themselves so much that each
      determined to break his oath, and sleep with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it happened otherwise, for when it was time to retire to rest,
      the women said good night to their husbands and left them, and shut
      themselves up in a chamber near, where each had ordered her bed to be
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that that same evening there arrived in the house three
      Cordeliers, who were going to Geneva, and who ordered a chamber not very
      far from that of the merchant's wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The women, when they were alone, began to talk about a hundred thousand
      things, and though there were only three of them they made enough noise
      for forty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good Cordeliers, hearing all this womens' chatter, came out of their
      chamber, without making any noise, and approached the door without being
      heard. They saw three pretty women, each lying by herself in a fair bed,
      big enough to accommodate a second bed-fellow; then they saw and heard
      also the three husbands go to bed in another chamber, and they said to
      themselves that fortune had done them a good turn, and that they would be
      unworthy to meet with any other good luck if they were cowardly enough to
      allow this opportunity to escape them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So," said one of them, "there needs no further deliberation as to what we
      are to do; we are three and they are three&mdash;let each take his place
      when they are asleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was said, so it was done, and such good luck had the good brothers
      that they found the key of the room in which the women were, and opened
      the door so gently that they were not heard by a soul, and they were not
      such fools when they had gained the outworks as not to close the door
      after them and take out the key, and then, without more ado, each picked
      out a bed-fellow, and began to ruffle her as well as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the women, believing it was her husband, spoke, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing? Do you not remember your vow?" But the good Cordelier
      answered not a word, but did that for which he came, and did it so
      energetically that she could not help assisting in the performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other two also were not idle, and the good women did not know what had
      caused their husbands thus to break their vow. Nevertheless, they thought
      they ought to obey, and bear it all patiently without speaking, each being
      afraid of being heard by her companions, for really each thought that she
      alone was getting the benefit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the good Cordeliers had done all they could, they left without saying
      a word, and returned to their chamber, each recounting his adventures. One
      had broken three lances; another, four; and the other, six. They rose
      early in the morning, and left the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good ladies, who had not slept all night, did not rise very early in
      the morning, for they fell asleep at daybreak, which caused them to get up
      late.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, their husbands, who had supped well the previous night,
      and who expected to be called by their wives, slept heavily till an hour
      so late that on other days they had generally travelled two leagues by
      that time.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the women got up, and dressed themselves as quickly as they could,
      and not without talking. And, amongst other things, the one who had the
      longest tongue, said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Between ourselves, mesdames&mdash;how have you passed the night? Have
      your husbands worked like mine did? He has not ceased to ruffle me all
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John!" said they, "if your husband ruffled you well last night,
      ours have not been idle. They have soon forgotten what they promised at
      parting; though believe us we did not forget to remind them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I warned mine also," said the first speaker, "when he began, but he did
      not leave off working, and hurried on like a hungry man who had been
      deprived of my company for two nights."
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were attired, they went to find their husbands, who were already
      dressed;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, good morning! you sleepers!" cried the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," said the men, "for having called us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath!" said one lady. "We have no more qualms of conscience for not
      calling you than you have for breaking your vow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What vow?" said one of the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The vow," said she, "that you made on leaving, not to sleep with your
      wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who has slept with his wife?" asked he. "You know well enough," said
      she, "and so do I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I also," said her companion. "Here is my husband who never gave me
      such a tumbling as he did last night&mdash;indeed if he had not done his
      duty so well I should not be so pleased that he had broken his vow, but I
      pass over that, for I suppose he is like young children, who when they
      know they deserve punishment, think they may as well be hanged for a sheep
      as a lamb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John! so did mine!" cried the third. "But I am not going to scold
      him for it. If there was any harm done there was good reason for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I declare by my oath," cried one of the men, "that you dream, and
      that you are drunken with sleep. As for me I slept alone, and did not
      leave my bed all night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor did I," said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I, by St. John!" said the third. "I would not on any account break my
      oath. And I feel sure that my friend here, and my neighbour there, who
      also promised, have not so quickly forgotten."
    </p>
    <p>
      The women began to change colour and to suspect some trickery, when one of
      the husbands began to fear the truth. Without giving the women time to
      reply, he made a sign to his companions, and said, laughing;
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath, madam, the good wine here, and the excellent cheer last night
      made us forget our promise; but be not displeased at the adventure; if it
      please God we each last night, with your help, made a fine baby, which is
      a work of great merit, and will be sufficient to wipe out the fault of
      breaking our vow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "May God will it so!" said the women. "But you so strongly declared that
      you had not been near us that we began to doubt a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We did it on purpose," said he, "in order to hear what you would say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so you committed a double sin; first to break your oath, then to
      knowingly lie about it; and also you have much troubled us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not worry yourselves about that," said he; "it is no great matter; but
      go to Mass, and we will follow you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The women set out towards the church, and their husbands remained behind,
      without following them too closely; then they all said together, without
      picking their words;
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are deceived! Those devils of Cordeliers have cuckolded us; they have
      taken our places, and shown us the folly of not sleeping with our wives.
      They should never have slept out of our rooms, and if it was dangerous to
      be in bed with them, is there not plenty of good straw to be had?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry!" said one of them, "we are well punished this time; but at any
      rate it is better that the trick should only be known to us than to us and
      our wives, for there would be much danger if it came to their knowledge.
      You hear by their confession that these ribald monks have done marvels&mdash;both
      more and better than we could do. And, if our wives knew that, they would
      not be satisfied with this experience only. My advice is that we swallow
      the business without chewing it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So help me God!" cried the third, "my friend speaks well. As for me, I
      revoke my vow, for it is not my intention to run any more risks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you will," said the other two; "and we will follow your example."
    </p>
    <p>
      So all the rest of the journey the wives slept with their husbands, though
      the latter took care not to explain the cause. And when the women saw
      that, they demanded the cause of this sudden change. And they answered
      deceitfully, that as they had begun to break their vow they had better go
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus were the three worthy merchants deceived by the three good
      Cordeliers, without it ever coming to the knowledge of their wives, who
      would have died of grief had they known the truth; for every day we see
      women die for less cause and occasion.

      STORY THE THIRTY-FIRST &mdash; TWO LOVERS FOR ONE LADY. <a
      href="#linklinknote-31" name="linklinknoteref-31" id="linklinknoteref-31">31</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De La Barde.
    </h3>
    <p>
      <i>Of a squire who found the mule of his companion, and mounted thereon
      and it took him to the house of his master's mistress; and the squire
      slept there, where his friend found him; also of the words which passed
      between them&mdash;as is more clearly set out below.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentleman of this kingdom&mdash;a squire of great renown and reputation&mdash;fell
      in love with a beautiful damsel of Rouen, and did all in his power to gain
      her good graces. But fortune was contrary to him, and his lady so unkind,
      that finally he abandoned the pursuit in despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not very wrong to do so, for she was provided with a lover&mdash;not
      that the squire knew of that, however much he might suspect it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He who enjoyed her love was a knight, and a man of great authority, and
      was so familiar with the squire as to tell him much concerning his
      love-affair. Often the knight said; "By my faith, friend, I would have you
      know that I have a mistress in this town to whom I am devoted; for,
      however tired I may be, I would willingly go three or four leagues to see
      her&mdash;a mere couple of leagues I would run over without stopping to
      take breath."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there no request or prayer that I can make" said the squire, "that
      will cause you to tell me her name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no!" said the other, "you shall not know that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" said the squire, "when I am so fortunate as to have something
      good, I will be as reticent as you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened some time after this that the good knight asked the squire to
      supper at the castle of Rouen, where he was then lodged. He came, and they
      had some talk; the gentle knight, who had an appointment to see his lady
      at a certain hour, said farewell to the squire, and added,
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that we have various things to see to to-morrow, and that we
      must rise early in order to arrange various matters. It is advisable
      therefore to go to bed early, and for that reason I bid you goodnight."
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire, who was cunning enough, suspected that the good knight wished
      to go somewhere, and that he was making the duties of the morrow an excuse
      to get rid of him, but he took no notice, and on taking leave and wishing
      good-night to his host, said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur you say well; rise early to-morrow morning, and I will do the
      same."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the good squire went down, he found a little mule at the foot of the
      staircase of the castle, with no one minding it. He soon guessed that the
      page he had met as he came down had gone to seek for a saddle-cloth for
      his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, ah" he said to himself, "my host did not get rid of me at this early
      hour for nothing. Here is his mule, which only waits till I am gone to
      carry his master to some place he does not wish me to know. Ah, mule!"
      said he, "if you could speak, you could tell me some news. Let me beg of
      you to lead me where your master wishes to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he made his page hold the stirrup, and mounted the mule, and
      laid the reins on the mule's neck, and let it amble on wherever it liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the little mule led him by streets and alleys here and there, till at
      last it stopped before a little wicket, which was in a side street where
      its master was accustomed to come, and which was the garden gate of the
      house of the very damsel the squire had so loved and had abandoned in
      despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dismounted, and tapped gently at the wicket, and a damsel, who was
      watching through a hidden lattice, believing it to be the knight, came
      down and opened the door, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur you are welcome; mademoiselle is in her chamber, and awaits
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not recognise him, because it was late, and he had a velvet cap
      drawn down over his face. And the good squire replied, "I will go to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The he whispered to his page, "Go quickly and put the mule where we found
      it; then go to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It shall be done, sir," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman closed the gate, and led the way to the chamber. Our good
      squire, much occupied with the business in hand, walked boldly to the room
      where the lady was, and he found her simply dressed in a plain petticoat,
      and with a gold chain round her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saluted her politely, for he was kind, courteous and well-spoken, but
      she, who was as much astonished as though horns had sprouted out of her
      head, did not for the moment know how to reply, but at last she asked him
      what he sought there, why he came at that hour, and who had sent him?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle," said he, "you may well imagine that if I had had to rely
      on myself alone I should not be here; but, thank God, one who has more
      pity for me than you ever had, has done this kindness to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who brought you here, sir?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath, mademoiselle, I will not conceal that from you; it was such
      and such a lord (and he named the knight who had invited him to supper),
      who sent me here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" she cried. "Traitor and disloyal knight that he is, has he betrayed
      my confidence? Well, well! I will be revenged on him some day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, mademoiselle! it is not right of you to say that, for it is no
      treason to give pleasure to one's friend, or to render him aid and service
      when one can. You know what a great friendship exists between him and me,
      and that neither hides from the other what is in his heart. It happened
      that not long ago I related and confessed to him the great love I bore
      you, and that because of you I had no happiness left in the world, for
      that by no means could I ever win your affection, and that it was not
      possible for me to long endure this horrible martyrdom. When the good
      knight knew that my words were really true, and was aware of the sorrow I
      endured, he was fain to tell me how he stood with regard to you, and
      preferred to lose you, and so save my life, than to see me die miserably
      and retain your affection. And if you are such a woman as you should be,
      you would not hesitate to give comfort and consolation to me, your
      obedient servant, who has always loyally served and obeyed you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg of you," she said, "not to speak of that, and to leave here at
      once. Cursed be he who made you come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know, mademoiselle," he replied, "that it is not my intention to
      leave here before to-morrow morning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath," she cried, "you will go now, at once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morbleu! I will not&mdash;for I will sleep with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw that he was not to be got rid of by hard words, she resolved
      to try kindness, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg of you with all my heart to leave my house now, and by my oath,
      another time I will do whatever you wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!" said he; "Waste no more words, for I shall sleep here," and with
      that he removed his cloak, and led the damsel to the table, and finally&mdash;to
      cut the tale short&mdash;she went to bed with him by her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not been in bed long, and he had but broken one lance, when the
      good knight arrived on his mule, and knocked at the wicket. When the
      squire heard that and knew who it was, he began to growl, imitating a dog
      very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight, hearing this, was both astonished and angry. He knocked at the
      door more loudly than before, and the other growled louder than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that growling?" said he outside. "Morbleu! but I will soon find
      out! Open the door, or I will carry it away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair damsel, who was in a great rage, went to the window in her
      chemise, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you there, false and disloyal knight? You may knock as much as you
      like, but you will not come in!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why shall I not come in?" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because," said she, "you are the falsest man that ever woman met, and are
      not worthy to be with respectable people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle," said he, "you blason my arms very well, but I do not know
      what excites you, for I have never been false to you that I am aware of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you have," she cried, "done me the greatest wrong that ever man did
      to woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not, I swear. But tell me who is in there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know very well, wretched traitor that you are," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the squire, who was in bed, began to growl like a dog as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry!" said he outside, "I do not understand this. Who is this growler?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John! you shall know," cried the other, and jumped out of bed and
      came to the window, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "And please you, sir, you have no right to wake us up."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good knight, when he knew who spoke to him, was marvellously
      astonished, and when at last he spoke, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you come here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I supped at your house and slept here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fault is mine," said he. Then addressing the damsel, he added,
      "Mademoiselle, do you harbour such guests in your house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, monseigneur," she replied, "and thank you for having sent him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?" said he. "By St. John I have nothing to do with it. I came to occupy
      my usual place, but it seems I am too late. At least I beg, since I cannot
      have anything else, that you open the door and let me drink a cup of
      wine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, you shall not enter here!" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John! he shall," cried the squire, and ran down and opened the
      door, and then went back to bed, and she did also, though, God knows, much
      ashamed and dissatisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the good knight entered the chamber, he lighted a candle, and looked
      at the couple in bed and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good luck to you, mademoiselle, and to you also squire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Many thanks, monseigneur," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the damsel could not say a word, her heart was so full, for she felt
      certain that the knight had connived at the squire's coming, and she felt
      so angry that she would not speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who showed you the way here, squire?" asked the knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your little mule, monseigneur," said he. "I found it at the foot of the
      stairs, when I supped with you at the castle. It was there alone, and
      seemingly lost, so I asked it what it was waiting for, and it replied that
      it was waiting for its saddle-cloth and you. 'To go where?' I asked.
      'Where we usually go,' replied the mule. 'I am sure,' said I, 'that your
      master will not leave the house to-night, for he is going to bed, so take
      me where you usually go, I beg.' It was content, so I mounted on it, and
      it brought me here, for which I give it thanks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God reward the little beast that betrayed me," said the good knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, you have fully deserved it, monseigneur," said the damsel, when at
      last she was able to speak. "I know well that you have deceived me, but I
      wish you to know that it is not much to your honour. There was no need, if
      you would not come yourself, to send some one else surreptitiously. It was
      an evil day for me when first I saw you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morbleu! I never sent him," he said; "but since he is here I will not
      drive him away. Besides there is enough for the two of us; is there not my
      friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, monseigneur, plenty of spoil to divide. Let us celebrate the
      arrangement by a drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the side-board and filled a large cup with wine, and said, "I
      drink to you, friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I pledge you, friend," said the other, and poured out another cup for
      the damsel, who refused to drink, but at last, unwillingly, kissed the
      cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, friend," said the knight, "I will leave you here. Ruffle her well;
      it is your turn to-day and will be mine to morrow, please God, and I hope
      you will be as obliging to me, if ever you find me here, as I am to you
      now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Our Lady, friend, doubt not but I shall be."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the knight went away and left the squire, who did as well as he could
      on the first night. And he told the damsel the whole truth of his
      adventure, at which she was somewhat relieved to find that he had not been
      sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus was the fair damsel deceived by the mule, and obliged to obey the
      knight and the squire, each in his turn&mdash;an arrangement to which she
      finally became accustomed. The knight and squire grew more attached to
      each other than before this adventure; their affection increased, and no
      evil counsels engendered discord and hate between them.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Villiers.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of the Cordeliers of Ostelleria in Catalonia, who took tithe from the
        women of the town, and how it was known, and the punishment the lord of
        that place and his subjects inflicted on the monks, as you shall learn
        hereafter.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In order that I may not be excluded from the number of fortunate and
      meritorious writers who have worked to increase the number of stories in
      this book, I will briefly relate a new story, which will serve as a
      substitute for the tale previously required of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a well-known fact that in the town of Hostelleria, in Catalonia, (*)
      there arrived some minor friars of the order of Observance, (**) who had
      been driven out of the kingdom of Spain.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) Hostalrich, a town of Catalonia, some 28 miles from
     Girona.

     (**) One of the principal branches of the order of
     Franciscans.
</pre>
    <p>
      They managed to worm themselves into the good graces of the Lord of that
      town, who was an old man, so that he built for them a fair church and a
      large convent, and maintained and supported them all his life as best he
      could. And after him came his eldest son, who did quite as much for them
      as his worthy father had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact they prospered so, that, in a few years they had everything that a
      convent of mendicant friars could desire. Nor were they idle during all
      the time they were acquiring these riches; they preached both in the town
      and in the neighbouring villages, and had such influence over the people
      that there was not a good christian who did not confess to them, they had
      such great renown for pointing out faults to sinners.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of all who praised them and held them in esteem, the women were
      foremost, such saints did they deem them on account of their charity and
      devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now listen to the wickedness, deception, and horrible treason which these
      false hypocrites practised on the men and women who every day gave them so
      many good gifts. They made it known to all the women in the town that they
      were to give to God a tenth of all their goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You render to your Lord such and such a thing; to your parish and priest
      such and such a thing; and to us you must render and deliver the tithe of
      the number of times that you have carnal connection with your husband. We
      will take no other tithe from you, for, as you know, we carry no money&mdash;for
      the temporal and transitory things of this world are nothing to us. We ask
      and demand only spiritual goods. The tithes which we ask and which you owe
      us are not temporal goods; as the Holy Sacrament, which you receive, is a
      divine and holy thing, so no one may receive the tithe but us, who are
      monks of the order of the Observance."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor simple women, who believed the good friars were more like angels
      than terrestrial beings, did not refuse to pay the tithe. There was not
      one who did not pay in her turn, from the highest to the lowest, even the
      wife of the Lord was not excused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus were all the women of the town parcelled out amongst these rascally
      monks, and there was not a monk who did not have fifteen or sixteen women
      to pay tithes to him, and God knows what other presents they had from the
      women, and all under cover of devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      This state of affairs lasted long without its ever coming to the knowledge
      of those who were most concerned in the payment of the new tithe; but at
      last it was discovered in the following manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young man who was newly married, was invited to supper at the house of
      one of his relations&mdash;he and his wife&mdash;and as they were
      returning home, and passing the church of the above-mentioned good
      Cordeliers, suddenly the bell rang out the <i>Ave Maria</i>, and the young
      man bowed to the ground to say his prayers.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife said, "I would willingly enter this church."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you do in there at this hour?" asked her husband. "You can
      easily come again when it is daylight; to-morrow, or some other time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg of you," she said, "to let me go: I will soon return."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Our Lady!" said he, "you shall not go in now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath!" she replied, "it is compulsory. I must go in, but I will not
      stay. If you are in a hurry to get home, go on, and I will follow you
      directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get on! get forward!" he said, "you have nothing to do here. If you want
      to say a <i>Pater noster</i>, or an <i>Ave Maria</i>, there is plenty of
      room at home, and it is quite as good to say it there as in this
      monastery, which is now as dark as pitch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry!" said she, "you may say what you like, but by my oath, it is
      necessary that I should enter here for a little while."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" said he. "Do you want to sleep with any of the brothers."
    </p>
    <p>
      She imagined that her husband knew that she paid the tithe, and replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I do not want to sleep with him; I only want to pay."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pay what?" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know very well," she answered; "Why do you ask?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do I know well?" he asked, "I never meddle with your debts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least," she said, "you know very well that I must pay the tithe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What tithe?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry!" she replied. "It always has to be paid;&mdash;the tithe for our
      nights together. You are lucky&mdash;I have to pay for us both."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And to whom do you pay?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To brother Eustace," she replied. "You go on home, and let me go in and
      discharge my debt. It is a great sin not to pay, and I am never at ease in
      my mind when I owe him anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too late to-night," said he, "he has gone to bed an hour ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath," said she, "I have been this year later than this. If one
      wants to pay one can go in at any hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along! come along!" he said. "One night makes no such great matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they returned home; both husband and wife vexed and displeased&mdash;the
      wife because she was not allowed to pay her tithe, and the husband because
      he had learned how he had been deceived, and was filled with anger and
      thoughts of vengeance, rendered doubly bitter by the fact that he did not
      dare to show his anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later they went to bed together, and the husband, who was cunning
      enough, questioned his wife indirectly, and asked if the other women of
      the town paid tithes as she did?
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my faith they do," she replied. "What privilege should they have more
      than me? There are sixteen to twenty of us who pay brother Eustace. Ah, he
      is so devout. And he has so much patience. Brother Bartholomew has as many
      or more, and amongst others my lady (*) is of the number. Brother Jacques
      also has many; Brother Anthony also&mdash;there is not one of them who has
      not a number."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) The wife of the Seigneur.
</pre>
    <p>
      "St. John!" said the husband, "they do not do their work by halves. Now I
      understand well that they are more holy than I thought them; and truly I
      will invite them all to my house, one after the other, to feast them and
      hear their good words. And since Brother Eustace receives your tithes, he
      shall be the first. See that we have a good dinner to-morrow, and I will
      bring him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most willingly," she replied, "for then at all events I shall not have to
      go to his chamber to pay him; he can receive it when he comes here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well said," he replied; "give it him here;" but as you may imagine he was
      on his guard, and instead of sleeping all night, thought over at his
      leisure the plan he intended to carry out on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner arrived, and Brother Eustace, who did not know his host's
      intentions stuffed a good meal under his hood. And when he had well eaten,
      he rolled his eyes on his hostess, and did not spare to press her foot
      under the table&mdash;all of which the host saw, though he pretended not
      to, however much to his prejudice it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the meal was over and grace was said, he called Brother Eustace and
      told him that he wanted to show him an image of Our Lady that he had in
      his chamber, and the monk replied that he would willingly come.
    </p>
    <p>
      They both entered the chamber, and the host closed the door so that he
      could not leave, and then laying hold of a big axe, said to the Cordelier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God's death, father! you shall never go out of this room&mdash;unless
      it be feet foremost&mdash;if you do not confess the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, my host, I beg for mercy. What is it you, would ask of me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ask," said he, "the tithe of the tithe you have received from my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Cordelier heard the word tithes, he began to think that he was in
      a fix, and did not know what to reply except to beg for mercy, and to
      excuse himself as well as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now tell me," said the husband, "what tithe it is that you take from my
      wife and the others?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor Cordelier was so frightened that he could not speak, and answered
      never a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me all about it," said the young man, "and I swear to you I will let
      you go and do you no harm;&mdash;but if you do not confess I will kill you
      stone dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the other felt convinced that he had better confess his sin and that
      of his companions and escape, than conceal the facts and be in danger of
      losing his life, he said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My host, I beg for mercy, and I will tell you the truth. It is true that
      my companions and I have made all the women of this town believe that they
      owe us tithes for all the times their husbands sleep with them. They
      believed us, and they all pay&mdash;young and old&mdash;when once they are
      married. There is not one that is excused&mdash;my lady even pays like the
      others&mdash;her two nieces also&mdash;and in general there is no one that
      is exempt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry!" said the other, "since my lord and other great folks pay it, I
      ought not to be dissatisfied, however much I may dislike it. Well! you may
      go, worthy father, on this condition&mdash;that you do not attempt to
      collect the tithe that my wife owes you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other was never so joyous as when he found himself outside the house,
      and said to himself that he would never ask for anything of the kind
      again, nor did he, as you will hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the host of the Cordelier was informed by his wife of this new tithe,
      he went to his Lord and told him all about the tax and how it concerned
      him. You may imagine that he was much astonished, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, cursed wretches that they are! Cursed be the hour that ever my father&mdash;whom
      may God pardon&mdash;received them! And now they take our spoils and
      dishonour us, and ere long they may do worse. What is to be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my faith, Monseigneur" said the other, "if it please you and seem good
      to you, you should assemble all your subjects in this town, for the matter
      touches them as much as you. Inform them of this affair, and consult with
      them what remedy can be devised before it is too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      Monseigneur approved, and ordered all his married subjects to come to him,
      and in the great hall of his castle, he showed them at full length why he
      had called them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      If my lord had been astonished and surprised when he heard the news, so
      also were all the good people who were there assembled. Some of them said,
      "We ought to kill them," others "They should be hanged!" others "Drown
      them!" Others said they could not believe it was true&mdash;the monks were
      so devout and led such holy lives. One said one thing, another said
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you," said the Seigneur, "what we will do. We will bring our
      wives hither, and Master John, or some other, shall preach a little sermon
      in which he will take care to make allusion to tithes, and ask the women,
      in the name of all of us, whether they discharge their debts, as we are
      anxious they should be paid, and we shall hear their reply."
    </p>
    <p>
      After some discussion they all agreed to the Seigneur's proposal. So
      orders were issued to all the married women of the town, and they all came
      to the great hall, where their husbands were assembled. My lord even
      brought my lady, who was quite astonished to see so many persons. An usher
      of my lord's commanded silence, and Master John, who was slightly raised
      above the other people, began the address which follows;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mesdames and mesdemoiselles, I am charged by my lord and those of his
      council to explain briefly the reason why you are called together. It is
      true that my lord, his council, and all his people who are here met
      together, desire to make a public examination of their conscience,&mdash;the
      cause being that that they wish (God willing) to make ere long a holy
      procession in praise of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and His Glorious Mother,
      and from the present moment to be in such a devout frame of mind that they
      may the better praise him in their prayers, and that all the works which
      they do may be most agreeable to God. You know that there have been no
      wars in our time, and that our neighbours have been terribly afflicted
      both by pestilence and famine. Whilst others have been cast down, we have
      nothing to complain of, and we must own that God has preserved us. There
      is good reason that we should acknowledge that this is not due to our own
      virtues, but to the great and liberal mercy of our Blessed Redeemer, who
      cries, calls, and invites us to put up in our parish church, devout
      prayers, to which we are to add great faith and firm devotion. The holy
      convent of the Cordeliers in this town has greatly aided, and still aids
      us in preserving the above-mentioned benefits. Moreover, we wish to know
      if you women also perform that which you have undertaken, and whether you
      sufficiently remember the obligation you owe the Church, and therefore it
      will be advisable that, by way of precaution, I should mention the
      principal points. Four times a year,&mdash;that is to say at the four
      Natales (*) you must confess to some priest or monk having the power of
      absolution, and if at each festival you receive your Creator that will be
      well done, but twice, or at least once a year, you ought to receive the
      Communion. Bring an offering every Sunday to each Mass; those who are able
      should freely give tithes to God&mdash;as fruit, poultry, lambs, pigs, and
      other accustomed gifts. You owe also another tithe to the holy monks of
      the convent of St. Francis, and which we earnestly desire to see paid. It
      greatly concerns us, and we desire it to be continued, nevertheless there
      are many of you who have not acted properly in this respect, and who by
      negligence, or backwardness, have neglected to pay in advance. You know
      that the good monks cannot come to your houses to seek their tithes;&mdash;that
      would disturb and trouble them too much; it is quite enough if they take
      the trouble to receive it. It is important that this should be mentioned&mdash;it
      remains to see who have paid, and who still owe."

    <p>
      Master John had no sooner finished his discourse, than more than twenty
      women began to cry at the same time, "I have paid!" "I have paid!" "I owe
      nothing!" "Nor I," "Nor I." A hundred other voices chimed in&mdash;generally
      to say that they owed nothing&mdash;and four or six pretty young women
      were even heard to declare that they had paid well in advance, one four
      times; one, six; and another, ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were also I know not how many old women who said not a word, and
      Master John asked them if they had paid their tithe, and they replied that
      they had made an arrangement with the Cordeliers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" said he, "you do not pay? You ought to advise and persuade the
      others to do their duty, and you yourselves are in default!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry!" said one of them, "I am not to blame. I have been several times
      to perform my duty, but my confessor would not listen to me: he always
      says he is too busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "St. John!" said the other old women, "we have compounded with the monks
      to pay them the tithe we owe them in linen, cloth, cushions, quilts,
      pillow-cases and such other trifles; and that by their own instructions
      and desire, for we should prefer to pay like the others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Our Lady!" said Master John, "there is no harm done; it is quite
      right.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose they can go away now; can they not?" said the Seigneur to
      Master John.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes!" said he, "but let them be sure and not forget to pay the tithe."
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had all left the hall, the door was closed, and every man
      present looked hard at his neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" said the Seigneur. "What is to be done? We know for certain what
      these ribald monks have done to us, by the confession of one of them, and
      by our wives; we need no further witness."
    </p>
    <p>
      After many and various opinions, it was resolved to set the convent on
      fire, and burn both monks and monastery.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to the bottom of the town, and came to the monastery, and took
      away the <i>Corpus Domini</i> and all the relics and sent them to the
      parish church. Then without more ado, they set fire to the convent in
      several places, and did not leave till all was consumed&mdash;monks,
      convent, church, dormitory, and all the other buildings, of which there
      were plenty. So the poor Cordeliers had to pay very dearly for the new
      tithe they had levied. Even God could do nothing, but had His house burned
      down.

      STORY THE THIRTY-THIRD &mdash; THE LADY WHO LOST HER HAIR.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a noble lord who was in love with a damsel who cared for another
        great lord, but tried to keep it secret; and of the agreement made
        between the two lovers concerning her, as you shall hereafter hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A noble knight who lived in the marches of Burgundy, who was wise,
      valiant, much esteemed, and worthy of the great reputation he had, was so
      much in the graces of a fair damsel, that he was esteemed as her lover,
      and obtained from her, at sundry times, all the favours that she could
      honourably give him. She was also smitten with a great and noble lord, a
      prudent man, whose name and qualities I pass over, though if I were to
      recount them there is not one of you who would not recognise the person
      intended, which I do not wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentle lord, I say, soon perceived the love affair of the valiant
      gentleman just named, and asked him if he were not in the good graces of
      such and such a damsel,&mdash;that is to say the lady before mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied that he was not, but the other, who knew the contrary to be
      case, said that he was sure he was,
    </p>
    <p>
      "For whatever he might say or do, he should not try to conceal such a
      circumstance, for if the like or anything more important had occurred to
      him (the speaker) he would not have concealed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      And having nothing else to do, and to pass the time, he found means to
      make her fall in love with him. In which he succeeded, for in a very short
      time he was high in her graces and could boast of having obtained her
      favours without any trouble to win them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other did not expect to have a companion, but you must not think that
      the fair wench did not treat him as well or better than before, which
      encouraged him in his foolish love. And you must know that the brave wench
      was not idle, for she entertained the two at once, and would with much
      regret have lost either, and more especially the last-comer, for he was of
      better estate and furnished with a bigger lance than her first lover; and
      she always assigned them different times to come, one after the other, as
      for instance one to-day and the other to-morrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last-comer knew very well what she was doing, but he pretended not to,
      and in fact he cared very little, except that he was rather disgusted at
      the folly of the first-comer, who esteemed too highly a thing of little
      value.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he made up his mind that he would warn his rival, which he did. He knew
      that the days on which the wench had forbidden him to come to her (which
      displeased him much) were reserved for his friend the first-comer. He kept
      watch several nights, and saw his rival enter by the same door and at the
      same hour as he did himself on the other days.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he said to him, "You well concealed your amours with such an one.
      I am rather astonished that you had so little confidence in me,
      considering what I know to be really the case between you and her. And in
      order that you may understand that I know all, let me tell you that I saw
      you enter her house at such and such an hour, and indeed no longer ago
      than yesterday I had an eye upon you, and from a place where I was, I saw
      you arrive&mdash;you know whether I speak the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first-comer heard this accusation, he did not know what to say,
      and he was forced to confess what he would have willingly concealed, and
      which he thought no one knew but himself; and he told the last-comer that
      he would not conceal the fact that he was in love, but begged him not to
      make it known.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what would you say," asked the other, "if you found you had a
      companion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Companion?" said he; "What companion? In a love affair? I never thought
      of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John!" said the last-comer, "I ought not to keep you longer in
      suspense&mdash;it is I. And since I see that you are in love with a woman
      who is not worth it, and if I had not more pity on you than you have on
      yourself I should leave you in your folly, but I cannot suffer such a
      wench to deceive you and me so long."
    </p>
    <p>
      If any one was astonished at this news it was the first-comer who believed
      himself firmly established in the good graces of the wench, and that she
      loved no one but him. He did not know what to say or think, and for a long
      time could not speak a word. When at last he spoke, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Our Lady! they have given me the onion (*) and I never suspected it. I
      was easily enough deceived. May the devil carry away the wench, just as
      she is!"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      (*) i.e. "they have made a fool of me."
</pre>
    <p>
      "She has fooled the two of us," said the last-comer;
    </p>
    <p>
      "at least she has begun well,&mdash;but we must even fool her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so I beg," said the first. "St. Anthony's fire burn me if ever I see
      the jade again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know," said the second, "that we go to her each in turn. Well, the
      next time that you go, you must tell her that you well know that I am in
      love with her, and that you have seen me enter her house at such an hour,
      and dressed in such a manner, and that, by heaven, if ever you find me
      there again you will kill me stone dead, whatever may happen to you. I
      will say the same thing about you, and we shall then see what she will say
      and do, and then we shall know how to act."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well said, and just what I would wish," said the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was arranged, so was it done, for some days later it was the
      last-comer's turn to go and visit her; he set out and came to the place
      appointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was alone with the wench, who received him very kindly and
      lovingly it appeared, he put on&mdash;as he well knew how&mdash;a
      troubled, bothered air, and pretended to be very angry. She, who had been
      accustomed to see him quite otherwise, did not know what to think, and she
      asked what was the matter, for his manner showed that his heart was not at
      ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, mademoiselle," said he, "you are right; and I have good cause to
      be displeased and angry. Moreover, it is owing to you that I am in this
      condition."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To me?" said she. "Alas, I have done nothing that I am aware of, for you
      are the only man in the world to whom I would give pleasure, and whose
      grief and displeasure touch my heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The man who refuses to believe that will not be damned," said he. "Do you
      think that I have not perceived that you are on good terms with so-and-so
      (that is to say the first-comer). It is so, by my oath, and I have but too
      often seen him speak to you apart, and, what is more, I have watched and
      seen him enter here. But by heaven, if ever I find him here his last day
      has come, whatever may happen to me in consequence. I could not allow him
      to be aware that he has done me this injury&mdash;I would rather die a
      thousand times if it were possible. And you are as false as he is for you
      know of a truth that after God I love no one but you, and yet you
      encourage him, and so do me great wrong!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, monseigneur!" she replied, "who has told you this story? By my soul!
      I wish that God and you should know that it is quite otherwise, and I call
      Him to witness that never in my life have I given an assignation to him of
      whom you speak, nor to any other whoever he may be&mdash;so you have
      little enough cause to be displeased with me. I will not deny that I have
      spoken to him, and speak to him every day, and also to many others, but I
      have never had aught to do with him, nor do I believe that he thinks of me
      even for a moment, or if so, by God he is mistaken. May God not suffer me
      to live if any but you has part or parcel in what is yours entirely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mademoiselle," said he, "you talk very well, but I am not such a fool as
      to believe you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Angry and displeased as he was, he nevertheless did that for which he
      came, and on leaving, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have told you, and given you fair warning that if ever I find any other
      person comes here, I will put him, or cause him to be put, in such a
      condition that he will never again worry me or any one else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Monseigneur," she replied, "by God you are wrong to imagine such
      things about him, and I am sure also that he does not think of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that, the last-comer left, and, on the morrow, his friend, the
      first-comer did not fail to come early in the morning to hear the news,
      and the other related to him in full all that had passed, how he had
      pretended to be angry and threatened to kill his rival, and the replies
      the jade made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath," said the first, "she acted the comedy well! Now let me have
      my turn, and I shall be very much surprised if I do not play my part
      equally well."
    </p>
    <p>
      A certain time afterwards his turn came, and he went to the wench, who
      received him as lovingly as she always did, and as she had previously
      received her other lover. If his friend the last-comer had been cross and
      quarrelsome both in manner and words, he was still more so, and spoke to
      her in this manner;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I curse the hour and the day on which I made your acquaintance, for it is
      not possible to load the heart of a poor lover with more sorrows, regrets,
      and bitter cares than oppress and weigh down my heart to-day. Alas! I
      chose you amongst all others as the perfection of beauty, gentleness, and
      kindness, and hoped that I should find in you truth and fidelity, and
      therefore I gave you all my heart, believing in truth that it was safe in
      your keeping, and I had such faith in you that I would have met death, or
      worse, had it been possible, to save your honour. Yet, when I thought
      myself most sure of your faith, I learned, not only by the report of
      others but by my own eyes, that another had snatched your love from me,
      and deprived me of the hope of being the one person in the world who was
      dearest to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend," said the wench, "I do not know what your trouble is, but from
      your manner and your words I judge that there is something the matter, but
      I cannot tell what it is if you do not speak more plainly&mdash;unless it
      be a little jealousy which torments you, and if so, I think, if you are
      wise, that you will soon banish it from your mind. For I have never given
      you any cause for that, as you know me well enough to be aware, and you
      should be sorry for having used such expressions to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not the sort of man," said he, "to be satisfied with mere words.
      Your excuses are worth nothing. You cannot deny that so-and-so (that is to
      say the last-comer) does not keep you. I know well he does, for I have
      noticed you, and moreover, have watched, and saw him yesterday come to you
      at such an hour, dressed in such and such a manner. But I swear to God he
      has had his last pleasure with you, for I bear him a grudge, and were he
      ten times as great a man as he is, when I meet him I will deprive him of
      his life, or he shall deprive me of mine; one of us two must die for I
      cannot live and see another enjoy you. You are false and disloyal to have
      deceived me, and it is not without cause that I curse the hour I made your
      acquaintance, for I know for a certainty that you will cause my death if
      my rival knows my determination, as I hope he will. I know that I am now
      as good as dead, and even if he should spare me, he does but sharpen the
      knife which is to shorten his own days, and then the world would not be
      big enough to save me, and die I must."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wench could not readily find a sufficient excuse to satisfy him in his
      present state of mind. Nevertheless, she did her best to dissipate his
      melancholy, and drive away his suspicions, and said to him;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend, I have heard your long tirade, which, to tell the truth, makes
      me reflect that I have not been so prudent as I ought, and have too
      readily believed your deceitful speeches, and obeyed you in all things,
      which is the reason you now think so little of me. Another reason why you
      speak to me thus, is that you know that I am so much in love with you that
      I cannot bear to live out of your presence. And for this cause, and many
      others that I need not mention, you deem me your subject and slave, with
      no right to speak or look at any but you. Since that pleases you, I am
      satisfied, but you have no right to suspect me with regard to any living
      person, nor have I any need to excuse myself. Truth, which conquers all
      things, will right me in the end!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, my dear," said the young man, "the truth is what I have already
      told you&mdash;as both and he will find to your cost if you do not take
      care."
    </p>
    <p>
      After these speeches, and others too long to recount here, he left, and
      did not forget on the following morning to recount everything to his
      friend the last-comer; and God knows what laughter and jests they had
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wench, who still had wool on her distaff (*), saw and knew very well
      that each of her lovers suspected the other, nevertheless she continued to
      receive them each in his turn, without sending either away. She warned
      each earnestly that he must come to her in the most secret manner, in
      order that he should not be perceived.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) i.e. plenty of tricks or resources.
</pre>
    <p>
      You must know that when the first-comer had his turn that he did not
      forget to complain as before, and threatened to kill his rival should he
      meet him. Also at his last meeting, he pretended to be more angry than he
      really was, and made very light of his rival, who, according to him, was
      as good as dead if he were caught with her. But the cunning and
      double-dealing jade had so many deceitful speeches ready that her excuses
      sounded as true as the Gospel. For she believed that, whatever doubts and
      suspicions they had, the affair would never really be found out, and that
      she was capable of satisfying them both.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was otherwise in the end, for the last-comer, whom she was greatly
      afraid to lose, one day read her a sharp lesson. In fact he told her that
      he would never see her again, and did not for a long time afterwards, at
      which she was much displeased and dissatisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in order to embarrass and annoy her still more, he sent to her a
      gentleman, a confidential friend, to point out how disgusted he was to
      find he had a rival, and to tell her, in short, that if she did not send
      away this rival, that he would never see her again as long as he lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you have already heard, she would not willingly give up his
      acquaintance, and there was no male or female saint by whom she did not
      perjure herself in explaining away her love passages with her other lover,
      and at last, quite beside herself, she said to the squire;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will show your master that I love him; give me your knife."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, when she had the knife, she took off her headdress, and with the
      knife cut off all her hair&mdash;not very evenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire, who knew the facts of the case, took this present, and said he
      would do his duty and give it to his master, which he soon did. The
      last-comer received the parcel, which he undid, and found the hair of his
      mistress, which was very long and beautiful. He did not feel much at ease
      until he had sent for his friend and revealed to him the message he had
      sent, and the valuable present she had given him in return, and then he
      showed the beautiful long tresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fancy," said he, "I must be very high in her good graces. You can
      scarcely expect that she would do as much for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John!" said the other, "this is strange news. I see plainly that I
      am left out in the cold. It is finished! You are the favoured one. But let
      us" he added, "think what is to be done. We must show her plainly that we
      know what she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I wish," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      They thought the matter over, and arranged their plan as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, or soon afterwards, the two friends were in a chamber where
      there were assembled their fair lady and many others. Each took his place
      where he liked; the first-comer sat near the damsel, and after some talk,
      he showed her the hair which she had sent to his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever she may have thought, she was not startled, but said she did not
      know whose hair it was, but it did not belong to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" he said. "Has it so quickly changed that it cannot be recognised?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I cannot say," she replied, "but it does not belong to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he heard that, he thought it was time to play his best card, and, as
      though by accident, gave her <i>chaperon</i> (*) such a twitch that it
      fell to the ground, at which she was both angry and ashamed. And all those
      who were present saw that her hair was short, and had been badly hacked.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) The chaperon, in the time of Charles VII, was fastened
     to the shoulder by a long band which sometimes passed two or
     three times round the neck, and sometimes hung down the
     back.
</pre>
    <p>
      She rose in haste, and snatched up her head-dress, and ran into another
      chamber to attire herself, and he followed her. He found her angry and
      ashamed, and weeping bitterly with vexation at being thus caught. He asked
      her what she had to weep about, and at what game she had lost her hair?
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not know what to reply, she was so vexed and astonished; and he,
      who was determined to carry out the arrangement he had concluded with his
      friend, said to her;
    </p>
    <p>
      "False and disloyal as you are, you have not cared that I and my friend
      were deceived and dishonoured. You wished,&mdash;as you have plainly shown&mdash;to
      add two more victims to your list, but, thank God, we were on our guard.
      And, in order that you may see that we both know you, here is your hair
      which you sent him, and which he has presented to me; and do not believe
      that we are such fools as you have hitherto thought us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he called his friend, who came, and the first said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have given back this fair damsel her hair, an have begun to tell her
      how she has accepted the love of both of us, and how by her manner of
      acting she has shown us that she did not care whether she disgraced us
      both&mdash;may God save us!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly&mdash;by St. John!" said the other, and thereupon he made a long
      speech to the wench, and God knows he talked to her well, remonstrating
      with her on her cowardice and disloyal heart. Never was woman so well
      lectured as she was at that time, first by one then by the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was so taken by surprise that she did not know what to reply, except
      by tears, which she shed abundantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never had enough pleasure out of both her lovers to compensate for
      the vexation she suffered at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, in the end they did not desert her, but lived as they did
      before, each taking his turn, and if by chance they both came to her
      together, the one gave place to the other, and they were both good friends
      as before, without ever talking of killing or fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time the two friends continued this pleasant manner of loving,
      and the poor wench never dared to refuse either of them. And whenever the
      one wished to have intercourse with her, he told the other, and whenever
      the second went to see her, the first stayed at home. They made each other
      many compliments, and sent one another rondels and songs which are now
      celebrated, about the circumstances I have already related, and of which I
      now conclude the account.

    <h3>
      By Monsigneur De La Roche.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a married woman who gave rendezvous to two lovers, who came and
        visited her, and her husband came soon after, and of the words which
        passed between them, as you shall presently hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I knew in my time a brave and worthy woman, deserving to be remembered and
      respected, for her virtues should not be hidden and kept dark, but
      publicly blazoned to the world. You will shortly hear, if you will, in
      this story something which will increase and magnify her fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gallant wench was married to a countryman of ours, and had many
      lovers seeking and desiring her favours,&mdash;which were not over
      difficult to obtain, for she was so kind and compassionate that she both
      would and could bestow herself freely whenever she liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened one day that two men came to see her, as both were accustomed,
      to ask for a rendezvous. She would not have retreated before two or even
      three, and appointed a day and hour for each to come to her&mdash;the one
      at eight o'clock the morrow morning, and the other at nine, and charged
      each one expressly that he should not fail to keep his appointed hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      They promised on their faith and honour that if they were alive they would
      keep their assignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the morrow came, at about 6 o'clock in the morning, the husband of
      this brave wench rose, dressed himself, and called his wife, but she
      bluntly refused to get up when ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith!" she said, "I have such a headache that I cannot stand on my feet,
      or if I did get up I should die, I am so weak and worn-out; and, as you
      know, I did not sleep all the night. I beg of you to leave me here, and I
      hope that when I am alone I shall get a little rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband, though he suspected something, did not dare to contradict her
      or reply, but went about his business in the town, whilst his wife was not
      idle at home, for eight o'clock had no sooner struck than the honest
      fellow, to whom on the previous day an assignation had been given, came
      and knocked at the door, and she let him in. He soon took off his long
      gown and his other clothes, and joined madame in bed, in order to cheer
      her up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst these two were locked in each other's arms, and otherwise engaged,
      the time passed quickly without her noticing it, when she heard some one
      knock loudly at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" she said, "as I live, there is my husband; make haste and take your
      clothes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your husband?" he said, "Why, do you know his knock?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," she replied, "I know it very well. Make haste lest he find you
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it be your husband, he must find me here, for I know not where I can
      hide."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, please God, he must not find you here, for you would be killed and so
      should I, he is so terrible. Get up into this little attic, and keep quite
      quiet and do not move, that he may not find you here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other climbed into the garret as he was told, and found the planks
      stripped away in many places, and the laths broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was safe, mademoiselle made one bound to the door, knowing
      very well that it was not her husband who was there, and let in the man
      who had promised to come to her at nine o'clock. They came into the
      chamber, where they were not long on their feet, but laid down and cuddled
      and kissed in the same manner as he in the garret had done, whilst he,
      through a chink, kept his eye on the couple, and was not best pleased. He
      could not make up his mind whether he should speak or hold his tongue. At
      last he determined to keep silence, and not say a word till the
      opportunity came,&mdash;and you may guess that he had plenty of patience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he was waiting and looking at the lady engaged with the last comer,
      the worthy husband came home to enquire after the health of his good wife,
      as it was very proper of him to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      She soon heard him, and as quickly as may be, made her lover get out of
      bed, and as she did not know where to hide him, since she could not put
      him in the garret, she made him lie down between the bed and the wall, and
      covered him with his clothes, and said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no better place to put you&mdash;have a little patience."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hardly finished speaking when her husband came into the room, and
      though he had heard nothing, he found the bed all rumpled and tossed
      about, the quilt dirty and soiled, and looking more like the bed of a
      bride than the couch of an invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doubts he had formerly entertained, combined with the appearance of
      the bed, made him call his wife by her name, and say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wicked whore that you are! I did not believe you when you shammed illness
      this morning! Where is the whoremonger? I swear to God, if I find him, he
      will have a bad end, and you too." Then, putting his hand on the quilt, he
      went on. "This looks nice, doesn't it? It looks as though the pigs had
      slept on it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter with you, you nasty drunkard?" she replied. "Why make
      me suffer when you get too much wine in your belly? That's a nice
      salutation, to call me a whore! I would have you to know that I am nothing
      of the kind, but much too virtuous and too honest for a rascal like you,
      and my only regret is that I have been so good to you, for you are not
      worth it. I do not know why I do not get up and scratch your face in such
      a manner that you would remember it all your life, for having abused me
      without cause."
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ask how she dared reply to her husband in this manner, I should
      answer there were two reasons,&mdash;that is she had both right and might
      on her side. For, as you may guess, if it had come to blows, both the
      lover in the garret, and the one by the bed, would have come to her
      assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor husband did not know what to say when he heard his wife abuse him
      thus, and as he saw that big words were of no use, he left the matter to
      God, who does justice to all, and replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You make many excuses for your palpable faults, but I care little what
      you say. I am not going to quarrel and make a noise; there is One above
      who will repay all!"
    </p>
    <p>
      By "One above", he meant God,&mdash;as though he had said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "God, who gives everyone his due, will repay you according to your
      deserts." But the gallant who was in the garret, and heard these words,
      really believed they were meant for him, and that he was expected to pay
      for the misdeeds of another besides himself, and he replied aloud;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Surely it will suffice if I pay half! The man who is down by the
      side of the bed can pay the other half&mdash;he is as much concerned as I
      am!"
    </p>
    <p>
      You may guess that the husband was much astonished, for he thought that
      God was speaking to him; and the man by the bed did not know what to
      think, for he knew nothing about the existence of the other man. He
      quickly jumped up, and the other man came down, and they recognised each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went off together, and left the couple looking vexed and angry, but
      they did not trouble much about that and for good reason.

    <h2>
      STORY THE THIRTY-FIFTH &mdash; THE EXCHANGE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Villiers.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a knight whose mistress married whilst he was on his travels, and
        on his return, by chance he came to her house, and she, in order that
        she might sleep with him, caused a young damsel, her chamber-maid, to go
        to bed with her husband; and of the words that passed between the
        husband and the knight his guest, as are more fully recorded hereafter.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A gentleman, a knight of this kingdom, a most virtuous man, and of great
      renown, a great traveller and a celebrated warrior, fell in love with a
      very beautiful damsel, and so advanced in her good graces that nothing
      that he demanded was refused him. It happened, I know not how long after
      that, this good knight, to acquire honour and merit, left his castle, in
      good health and well accompanied, by the permission of his master, to bear
      arms elsewhere, and he went to Spain and various places, where he did such
      feats that he was received in great triumph at his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time the lady married an old knight who was courteous and
      wise, and who in his time had been a courtier, and&mdash;to say truth&mdash;was
      known as the very mirror of honour. It was a matter for regret that he did
      not marry better, but at any rate he had not then discovered his wife's
      misconduct, as he did afterwards, as you shall hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first-named knight, returning from the war, as he was travelling
      through the country, arrived by chance one night at the castle where his
      mistress lived, and God knows what good cheer she and her husband made for
      him, for there had been a great friendship between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you must know that whilst the master of the house was doing all he
      could to honour his guest, the guest was conversing with his former
      lady-love, and was willing to renew with her the intimacy that had existed
      before she married. She asked for nothing better, but excused herself on
      account of want of opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not possible to find a chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, madam," he said, "by my oath, if you want to, you will make a chance.
      When your husband is in bed and asleep, you can come to my chamber, or, if
      you prefer it, I will come to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cannot be managed so," she replied; "the danger is too great; for
      monseigneur is a very light sleeper, and he never wakes but what he feels
      for me, and if he did not find me, you may guess what it would be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And when he does find you," he said, "what does he do to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing else," she replied; "he turns over on the other side."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith!" said he, "he is a very bad bed-fellow; it is very lucky for you
      that I came to your aid to perform for you what he cannot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So help me God," she said, "when he lies with me once a month it is the
      best he can do. I may be difficult to please, but I could take a good deal
      more than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not to be wondered at," he said; "but let us consider what we
      shall do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no way that I see," she replied, "that it can be managed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" he said; "have you no woman in the house to whom you can explain
      the difficulty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, by God! I have one," she said, "in whom I have such confidence that
      I would tell her anything in the world I wanted kept secret? without
      fearing that she would ever repeat it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What more do we want then?" he said. "The rest concerns you and her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady who was anxious to be with her lover, called the damsel, and
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you must help me to-night to do something which is very dear to
      my heart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam," said the damsel, "I am ready and glad, as I ought to be, to serve
      you and obey you in any way possible; command me, and I will perform your
      orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, my dear," said madam, "and be sure that you will lose
      nothing by it. This is what is the matter. The knight here is the man whom
      I love best in all the world, and I would not that he left here without my
      having a few words with him. Now he cannot tell me what is in his heart
      unless we be alone together, and you are the only person to take my place
      by the side of monseigneur. He is accustomed, as you know, to turn in the
      night and touch me, and then he leaves me and goes to sleep again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do your pleasure, madam; there is nothing that you can command
      that I will not do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear," she said, "you will go to bed as I do, keeping a good way
      off from monseigneur, and take care that if he should speak to you not to
      reply, and suffer him to do whatever he may like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do your pleasure, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper-time came. There is no need to describe the meal, suffice it to say
      there was good cheer and plenty of it, and after supper, sports, and the
      visitor took madam's arm, and the other gentlemen escorted the other
      damsels. The host came last, and enquired about the knight's travels from
      an old gentleman who had accompanied him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame did not forget to tell her lover that one of her women would take
      her place that night, and that she would come to him; at which he was very
      joyful, and thanked her much, and wished that the hour had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      They returned to the reception hall, where monseigneur said good night to
      his guest, and his wife did the same. The visitor went to his chamber,
      which was large and well-furnished, and there was a fine sideboard laden
      with spices and preserves, and good wine of many sorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon undressed, and drank a cup, and made his attendants drink also,
      and then sent them to bed, and remained alone, waiting for the lady, who
      was with her husband. Both she and her husband undressed and got into bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The damsel was in the <i>ruelle</i>, and as soon as my lord was in bed,
      she took the place of her mistress, who&mdash;as her heart desired&mdash;made
      but one bound to the chamber of the lover, who was anxiously awaiting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus were they all lodged&mdash;monseigneur with the chambermaid, and his
      guest with madame&mdash;and you may guess that these two did not pass all
      the night in sleeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monseigneur, as was his wont, awoke an hour before day-break, and turned
      to the chamber-maid, believing it to be his wife, and to feel her he put
      out his hand, which by chance encountered one of her breasts, which were
      large and firm, and he knew at once that it was not his wife, for she was
      not well furnished in that respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha!" he said to himself, "I understand what it is! They are playing
      me a trick, and I will play them another."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned towards the girl, and with some trouble managed to break a
      lance, but she let him do it without uttering a word or half a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had finished, he began to call as loudly as he could to the man
      who was sleeping with his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo! my lord of such a place! Where are you? Speak to me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other, when he heard himself called, was much astonished, and the lady
      quite overwhelmed with shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" she said, "our deeds are discovered: I am a lost woman!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband called out,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, monseigneur! hallo, my guest! Speak to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other ventured to speak, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, so please you, monsiegneur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will make this exchange with you whenever you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What exchange?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An old, worn-out false, treacherous woman, for a good, pretty, and fresh
      young girl. That is what I have gained by the exchange and I thank you for
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      None of the others knew what to reply, even the poor chamber-maid wished
      she were dead, both on account of the dishonour to her mistress and the
      unfortunate loss of her own virginity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitor left the lady and the castle as soon as could, without
      thanking his host, or saying farewell. And never again did he go there, so
      he never knew how she settled the matter with her husband afterwards, so I
      can tell you no more.

    <h2>
      STORY THE THIRTY-SIXTH &mdash; AT WORK.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De La Roche.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a squire who saw his mistress, whom he greatly loved, between two
        other gentlemern, and did not notice that she had hold of both of them
        till another knight informed him of the matter as you will hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A kind and noble gentleman, who wished to spend his time in the service of
      the Court of Love, devoted himself, heart, body, and goods, to a fair and
      honest damsel who well deserved it, and who was specially suited to do
      what she liked with men; and his amour with her lasted long. And he
      thought that he stood high in her good graces, though to say the truth, he
      was no more a favourite than the others, of whom there were many.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened one day that this worthy gentleman found his lady, by chance,
      in the embrasure of a window, between a knight and a squire, to whom she
      was talking. Sometimes she would speak to one apart and not let the other
      hear, another time she did the same to the other, to please both of them,
      but the poor lover was greatly vexed and jealous, and did not dare to
      approach the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only thing to do was to walk away from her, although he desired her
      presence more than anything else in the world. His heart told him that
      this conversation would not tend to his advantage, in which he was not far
      wrong. For, if his eyes had not been blinded by affection, he could easily
      have seen what another, who was not concerned, quickly perceived, and
      showed him, in this wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he saw and knew for certain that the lady had neither leisure nor
      inclination to talk to him, he retired to a couch and lay down, but he
      could not sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he was thus sulking, there came a gentleman, who saluted all the
      company, and seeing that the damsel was engaged, withdrew to the recess
      where the squire was lying sleepless upon the couch; and amongst other
      conversation the squire said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my faith, monseigneur, look towards the window; there are some people
      who are making themselves comfortable. Do you not see how pleasantly they
      are talking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John, I see them," said the knight, "and see that they are doing
      something more than talking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else?" said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else? Do you not see that she has got hold of both of them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got hold of them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly yes, poor fellow! Where are your eyes? But there is a great
      difference between the two, for the one she holds in her left hand is
      neither so big nor so long as that which she holds in her right hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha!" said the squire, "you say right. May St. Anthony burn the wanton;"
      and you may guess that he was not well pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take no heed," said the knight, "and bear your wrong as patiently as you
      can. It is not here that you have to show your courage: make a virtue of
      necessity."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having thus spoken, the worthy knight approached the window where the
      three were standing, and noticed by chance that the knight on the left,
      hand, was standing on tip-toe, attending to what the fair damsel and the
      squire were saying and doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giving him a slight tap on his hat, the knight said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind your own business in the devil's name, and don't trouble about other
      people."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other withdrew, and began to laugh, but the damsel, who was not the
      sort of woman to care about trifles, scarcely showed any concern, but
      quietly let go her hold without brushing or changing colour, though she
      was sorry in her heart to let out of her hand what she could have well
      used in another place.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you may guess, both before and after that time, either of those two
      would most willingly have done her a service, and the poor, sick lover was
      obliged to be a witness of the greatest misfortune which could happen to
      him, and his poor heart would have driven him to despair, if reason had
      not come to his help, and caused him to abandon his love affairs, out of
      which he had never derived any benefit.

    <h2>
      STORY THE THIRTY-SEVENTH &mdash; THE USE OF DIRTY WATER.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De La Roche.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a jealous man who recorded all the tricks which he could hear or
        learn by which wives had deceived their husbands in old times; but at
        last he was deceived by means of dirty water which the lover of the said
        lady threw out of window upon her as she was going to Mass, as you shall
        hear hereafter.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Whilst others are thinking and ransacking their memories for adventures
      and deeds fit to be narrated and added to the present history, I will
      relate to you, briefly, how the most jealous man in this kingdom, in his
      time, was deceived. I do not suppose that he was the only one who ever
      suffered this misfortune, but at any rate I will not omit to describe the
      clever trick that was played upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This jealous old hunks was a great historian, and had often read and
      re-read all sorts of stories; but the principal end and aim of all his
      study was to learn and know all the ways and manners in which wives had
      deceived their husbands. For&mdash;thank God&mdash;old histories like
      Matheolus (*), Juvenal, the Fifteen Joys of Marriage (**), and more others
      than I can count, abound in descriptions of deceits, tricks, and
      deceptions of that sort.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) <i>Le Lime</i>, de Matheolus, a poem of the early part of the
     15th Century, written by Jean le Febvre, Bishop of
     Therouenne. It is a violent satire against women.

     (**) A curious old work the authorship of which is still
     doubtful. It is often ascribed to Antoine de la Sale, who is
     believed to have partly written and edited the <i>Cent
     Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>. The allusion is interesting as showing
     that the Quinze Joyes de mariage was written before the
     present work.
</pre>
    <p>
      Our jealous husband had always one or other of these books in his hand,
      and was as fond of them as a fool is of his bauble,&mdash;reading or
      studying them; and indeed he had made from these books a compendium for
      his own use, in which all the tricks and deceits practised by wives on
      their husbands were noted and described.
    </p>
    <p>
      This he had done in order to be forewarned and on his guard, should his
      wife perchance use any of the plans or subterfuges chronicled or
      registered in his book. For he watched his wife as carefully as the most
      jealous Italian would, and still was not content, so ruled was he by this
      cursed passion of jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this delectable state did the poor man live three or four years with
      his wife, and the only amusement she had in that time was to escape out of
      his hateful presence by going to Mass, and then she was always accompanied
      by an old servant, who was charged to watch over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentle knight, who had heard how the fair lady was watched, one day met
      the damsel, who was both beautiful and witty, and told her how willing he
      was to do her a service, that he sighed for her love, and condoled with
      her evil fortune in being allied to the most jealous wretch there was on
      the face of the earth, and saying, moreover, that she was the sole person
      on earth for whom he cared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And since I cannot tell you here how much I love you, and many other
      things which I hope you will be glad to hear, I will, if you wish, put it
      all in writing and give it you to-morrow, begging also that any small
      service that I most willingly do for you, be not refused."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gladly listened, but owing to the presence of Dangier, (*) who was
      near, hardly replied; nevertheless she said she would be glad to have his
      letter when it came.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
      (*) See note page 159.
</pre>
    <p>
      Her lover was very joyful when he took leave of her, and with good cause,
      and the damsel said farewell to him in a kind and gracious manner, but the
      old woman, who watched her, did not fail to ask her what conversation had
      taken place between her and the man who had just left.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He brought me news of my mother," she replied; "at which I am very
      joyful, for she is in good health."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman asked no more, and they returned home.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow, the lover, provided with a letter written God knows in what
      terms, met the lady, and gave her this letter so quickly and cunningly
      that the old servant, who was watching, saw nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter was opened by her most joyfully when she was alone. The gist of
      the contents was that he had fallen in love with her, and that he knew not
      a day's happiness when he was absent from her, and finally hoped that she
      would of her kindness appoint a suitable place where she could give him a
      reply to this letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrote a reply in which she said she could love no one but her husband,
      to whom she owed all faith and loyalty; nevertheless, she was pleased to
      know the writer was so much in love with her, but, though she could
      promise him no reward, would be glad to hear what he had to say, but
      certainly that could not be, because her husband never left her except
      when she went to church, and then she was guarded, and more than guarded,
      by the dirtiest old hag that ever interfered with anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lover, dressed quite differently to what he had been the preceding
      day, met the lady, who knew him at once, and as he passed close to her,
      received from her hand the letter already mentioned. That he was anxious
      to know the contents was no marvel. He went round a corner, and there, at
      his leisure, learned the condition of affairs, which seemed to be
      progressing favourably.
    </p>
    <p>
      It needed but time and place to carry out his enterprise, and he thought
      night and day how this was to be accomplished. At last he thought of a
      first-rate trick, for he remembered that a lady friend of his lived
      between the church where his lady went to Mass and her house, and he told
      her the history of his love affair, concealing nothing from her, and
      begging her to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever I can do for you, I will do with all my heart," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you," said he. "Would you mind if I met her here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith!" she said, "to please you, I do not mind!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" he replied, "if ever it is in my power to do you a service, you
      may be sure that I will remember this kindness."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not satisfied till he had written again to his lady-love and given
      her the letter, in which he said that he had made an arrangement with a
      certain woman, "who is a great friend of mine, a respectable woman, who
      can loyally keep a secret, and who knows you well and loves you, and who
      will lend us her house where we may meet. And this is the plan I have
      devised. I will be to-morrow in an upper chamber which looks on the
      street, and I will have by me a large pitcher of water mingled with ashes,
      which I will upset on you suddenly as you pass. And I shall be so
      disguised that neither your old woman, nor anyone else in the world, will
      recognise me. When you have been drenched with this water, you will
      pretend to be very angry and surprised, and take refuge in the house, and
      send your Dangier to seek another gown; and while she is on the road we
      will talk together."
    </p>
    <p>
      To shorten the story, the letter was given, and the lady, who was very
      well pleased, sent a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day came, and the lady was drenched by her lover with a pitcher
      of water and cinders, in such fashion that her kerchief, gown, and other
      habiliments were all spoiled and ruined. God knows that she was very
      astonished and displeased, and rushed into the house, as though she were
      beside herself, and ignorant of where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw the lady of the house, she complained bitterly of the
      mischief which had been done, and I cannot tell you how much she grieved
      over this misadventure. Now she grieved for her kerchief, now for her
      gown, and another time for her other clothes,&mdash;in short, if anyone
      had heard her, they would have thought the world was coming to an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman, who was also in a great rage, had a knife in her hand, with
      which she scraped the gown as well as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, my friend! you only waste your time. It cannot be cleaned as
      easily as that: you cannot do any good. I must have another gown and
      another kerchief-there is nothing else to be done. Go home and fetch them,
      and make haste and come back, or we shall lose the Mass in addition to our
      other troubles."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman seeing that there was imperative need of the clothes, did
      not dare to refuse her mistress, and took the gown and kerchief under her
      mantle, and went home.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had scarcely turned on her heels, before her mistress was conducted to
      the chamber where her lover was, who was pleased to see her in a simple
      petticoat and with her hair down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst they are talking together, let us return to the old woman, who went
      back to the house, where she found her master, who did not wait for her to
      speak, but asked her at once,
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have you done with my wife? where is she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have left her," she replied, "at such a person's house, in such a
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for what purpose?" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she showed him the gown and the kerchief, and told him about the
      pitcher of water and ashes, and said that she had been sent to seek other
      clothes, for her mistress could not leave the place where she was in that
      state.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so?" said he. "By Our Lady! that trick is not in my book! Go! Go!
      I know well what has happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      He would have added that he was cuckolded, and I believe he was at that
      time, and he never again kept a record of the various tricks that had been
      played on husbands. Moreover, it is believed that he never forgot the
      trick which had been played on him. There was no need for him to write it
      down&mdash;he preserved a lively memory of it the few good days that he
      had to live.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By The Seneschal Of Guyenne.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a citizen of Tours who bought a lamprey which he sent to his wife
        to cook in order that he might give a feast to the priest, and the said
        wife sent it to a Cordelier, who was her lover, and how she made a woman
        who was her neighbour sleep with her husband, and how the woman was
        beaten, and what the wife made her husband believe, as you will hear
        hereafter.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      There was formerly a merchant of Tours, who, to give a feast to his curé
      and other worthy people, bought a large lamprey, and sent it to his house,
      and charged his wife to cook it, as she well knew how to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And see," said he, "that the dinner is ready at twelve o'clock, for I
      shall bring our curé, and some other people" (whom he named).
    </p>
    <p>
      "All shall be ready," she replied, "bring whom you will."
    </p>
    <p>
      She prepared a lot of nice fish, and when she saw the lamprey she wished
      that her paramour, a Cordelier, could have it, and said to herself,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, Brother Bernard, why are you not here? By my oath, you should not
      leave till you had tasted this lamprey, or, if you liked, you should take
      it to your own room, and I would not fail to keep you company."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was with great regret that the good woman began to prepare the lamprey
      for her husband, for she was thinking how the Cordelier could have it. She
      thought so much about it that she finally determined to send the lamprey
      by an old woman, who knew her secret. She did so, and told the Cordelier
      that she would come at night, and sup and sleep with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Cordelier heard that she was coming, you may guess that he was
      joyful and contented, and he told the old woman that he would get some
      good wine to do honour to the lamprey. The old woman returned, and
      delivered his message.
    </p>
    <p>
      About twelve o'clock came our merchant, the curé, and the other guests, to
      eat this lamprey, which had now gone far out of their reach. When they
      were all in the merchant's house, he took them all into the kitchen to
      show them the big lamprey that he was going to give them, and called his
      wife, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Show us our lamprey, I want to tell our guests how cheap I bought it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What lamprey?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lamprey that I gave you for our dinner, along with the other fish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have seen no lamprey," she said; "I think you must be dreaming. Here
      are a carp, two pike, and I know not what fish beside, but I have seen no
      lamprey to day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said he. "Do you think I am drunk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," replied the curé and the other guests, "we think no less. You are
      too niggardly to buy such a lamprey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God," said his wife, "he is either making fun of you or he is dreaming&mdash;for
      certainly I have never seen this lamprey."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband grew angry, and cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie, you whore! Either you have eaten it, or you have hidden it
      somewhere. I promise you it will be the dearest lamprey you ever had."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he turned to the curé and the others, and swore by God's death
      and a hundred other oaths, that he had given his wife a lamprey which had
      cost him a franc; but they, to tease him and torment him still more,
      pretended not to believe him, and that they were very disappointed, and
      said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "We were invited to dinner at such houses, but we refused in order to come
      here, thinking we were going to eat this lamprey; but, as far as we can
      see, there is no chance of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their host, who was in a terrible rage, picked up a stick, and advanced
      towards his wife to thrash her, but the others held him back, and dragged
      him by force out of the house, and with much trouble appeased him as well
      as they could. Then, since they could not have the lamprey, the curé had
      the table laid, and they made as good cheer as they could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good dame meanwhile sent for one of her neighbours, who was a widow,
      but still good-looking and lively, and invited her to dinner; and when she
      saw her opportunity, she said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear neighbour, it would be very kind of you to do me a great service
      and pleasure, and if you will do this for me, I will repay you in a manner
      that will please you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what do you want me to do?" asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you," said she. "My husband is so violent in his night-work
      that it is astounding, and, in fact, last night he so tumbled me, that by
      my oath I am afraid of him to-night. Therefore I would beg of you to take
      my place, and if ever I can do anything for you in return, you may command
      me&mdash;body and goods."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good neighbour, to oblige her, promised to take her place&mdash;for
      which she was greatly thanked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that our merchant when he returned from dinner, laid in
      a good stock of birch rods, which he carried secretly into his house, and
      hid near his bed, saying to himself that if his wife worried him she
      should be well paid.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not do this so secretly but what his wife was on her guard and
      prepared, for she knew by long experience her husband's brutality.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not sup at home, but stopped out late, and came home when he
      expected she would be in bed and naked. But his design failed, for late
      that evening she made her neighbour undress and go to bed in her place,
      and charged her expressly not to speak to her husband when he came, but
      pretend to be dumb and ill. And she did more, for she put out the fire
      both in the chamber and in the kitchen. That being done, she told her
      neighbour that as soon as ever her husband rose in the morning, she was to
      leave and return to her own house, and she promised that she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbour being thus put to bed, the brave woman went off to the
      Cordelier to eat the lamprey and gain her pardons, as was her custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was feasting there, the merchant came home after supper, full of
      spite and anger about the lamprey, and to execute the plan he had
      conceived, took his rods in his hand and then searched for a light for the
      candle, but found no fire even in the chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he saw that, he went to bed without saying a word, and slept till
      dawn, when he rose and dressed, and took his rods, and so thrashed his
      wife's substitute, in revenge for the lamprey, till she bled all over, and
      the sheets of the bed were as bloody as though a bullock had been flayed
      on them, but the poor woman did not dare to say a word, or even to show
      her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      His rods being all broken, and his arm tired, he left the house, and the
      poor woman, who had expected to enjoy the pleasant pastime of the sports
      of love, went home soon afterwards to bemoan her ill-luck and her wounds,
      and not without cursing and threatening the woman who had brought this
      upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the husband was still away from home, the good woman returned from
      seeing the Cordelier, and found the bed-chamber all strewn with birch
      twigs, the bed all crumpled, and the sheets covered with blood, and she
      then knew that her neighbour had suffered bodily injury, as she had
      expected. She at once remade the bed, and put on fresh and clean sheets,
      and swept the chamber, and then she went to see her neighbour, whom she
      found in a pitiable condition, and it need not be said was not able to
      give her any consolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she could, she returned home, and undressed, and laid down on
      the fair white bed that she had prepared, and slept well till her husband
      returned from the town, his anger quite dissipated by the revenge he had
      taken, and came to his wife whom he found in bed pretending to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the meaning of this, mademoiselle?" he said. "Is it not time to
      get up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh dear!" she said, "is it day yet? By my oath I never heard you get up.
      I was having a dream which had lasted a long time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect," he replied, "that you were dreaming about the lamprey, were
      you not? It would not be very wonderful if you did, for I gave you
      something to remember it by this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God!" she said, "I never thought about you or your lamprey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said he. "Have you so soon forgotten?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgotten?" she answered. "Why not? a dream is soon forgotten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, did you dream about the bundle of birch rods I used on you
      not two hours ago?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On me?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, certainly; on you," he said. "I know very well I thrashed you
      soundly, as the sheets of the bed would show."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath, dear friend," she replied, "I do not know what you did or
      dreamed, but for my part I recollect very well that this morning you
      indulged in the sports of love with much desire; I am sure that if you
      dreamed you did anything else to me it must be like yesterday, when you
      made sure you had given me the lamprey."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be a strange dream," said he. "Show yourself that I may see
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned down the bed-clothes and showed herself quite naked, and
      without mark or wound. He saw also that the sheets were fair and white,
      and without any stain. It need not be said that he was much astonished,
      and he thought the matter over for a long time, and was silent. At last he
      said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath, my dear, I imagined that I gave you a good beating this
      morning, even till you bled&mdash;but I see well I did nothing of the
      kind, and I do not know exactly what <i>did</i> happen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry!" she said "Get the idea that you have beaten me out of your head,
      for you never touched me, as you can see. Make up your mind that you
      dreamed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure you are right," said he, "and I beg of you to pardon me, for I
      did wrong to abuse you before all the strangers I brought to the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is easily pardoned," she replied; "but at any rate take care that
      you are not so rash and hasty another time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I will not be, my dear!" said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, as you have heard, was the merchant deceived by his wife, and made
      to believe that he had dreamed that he had bought the lamprey; also in the
      other matters mentioned above.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Saint Pol.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a knight who, whilst he was waiting for his mistress amused
        himself three times with her maid, who had been sent to keep him company
        that he might not be dull; and afterwards amused himself three times
        with the lady, and how the husband learned it all from the maid, as you
        will hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A noble knight of the Marches of Haynau&mdash;rich, powerful, brave, and a
      good fellow&mdash;was in love with a fair lady for a long time, and was so
      esteemed and secretly loved by her, that whenever he liked he repaired to
      a private and remote part of her castle, where she came to visit him, and
      they conversed at their leisure of their pleasant mutual love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a soul knew of their pleasant pastime, except a damsel who served the
      lady, and who had kept the matter secret for a long time, and had served
      the dame so willingly in all her affairs that she was worthy of a great
      reward. Moreover, she was such a good girl, that not only had she gained
      the affection of her mistress for her services in this and other matters,
      but the husband of the lady esteemed her as much as his wife did, because
      he found her good, trustworthy, and diligent.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced one day that the lady knew her aforesaid lover to be in the
      house, but could not go to him as soon as she wished, because her husband
      detained her; at which she was much vexed, and sent the damsel to tell him
      that he must yet have patience, and that, as soon as she could get rid of
      her husband, she would come to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The damsel went to the knight, who was awaiting the lady, and delivered
      her message, and he, being a courteous knight, thanked her much for her
      message, and made her sit by him; then tenderly kissed her two or three
      times. She did not object, which gave the knight encouragement to proceed
      to other liberties, which also were not refused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being finished, she returned to her mistress, and told her that her
      lover was anxiously awaiting her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said the lady, "I know full well he is, but my husband will not go
      to bed, and there are a lot of people here whom I cannot leave. God curse
      them! I would much rather be with him. He is very dull, is he not&mdash;all
      alone up there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith! I believe he is," replied the damsel, "but he comforts himself as
      well as he can with the hope of your coming.''
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I believe, but at any rate he has been all alone, and without a
      light, for more than two hours; it must be very lonely. I beg you, my
      dear, to go back to him again and make excuses for me, and stay with him.
      May the devil take the people who keep me here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do what you please, madam, but it seems to me that he loves you so
      much you have no need to make excuses; and also, that, if I go, you will
      have no woman here, and perhaps monseigneur may ask for me and I cannot be
      found."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not trouble about that," said the lady. "I will manage that all right
      if he should ask for you. But it vexes me that my friend should be alone&mdash;go
      and see what he is doing, I beg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go, since you wish it," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      That she was pleased with her errand need not be said, though to conceal
      her willingness she had made excuses to her mistress. She soon came to the
      knight, who was still waiting, and said to him;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur, madame has sent me to you again to make her excuses for
      keeping you so long waiting, and to tell you how vexed she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may tell her," said he, "that she may come at her leisure, and not to
      hurry on my account, for you can take her place."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he kissed and cuddled her, and did not suffer her to depart till
      he had tumbled her twice, which was not much trouble to him, for he was
      young and vigorous, and fond of that sport.
    </p>
    <p>
      The damsel bore it all patiently, and would have been glad to often have
      the same luck, if she could without prejudice to her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was about to leave, she begged the knight to say nothing to her
      mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have no fear," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg of you to be silent," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she returned to her mistress, who asked what her friend was doing?
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is still," the damsel replied, "awaiting you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said the lady, "is he not vexed and angry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," said the damsel, "since he had company. He is much obliged to you
      for having sent me, and if he often had to wait would like to have me to
      talk to him to pass the time,&mdash;and, faith! I should like nothing
      better, for he is the pleasantest man I ever talked to. God knows that it
      was good to hear him curse the folks who detained you&mdash;all except
      monseigneur; he would say nothing against him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "St. John! I wish that he and all his company were in the river, so that I
      could get away."
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time monseigneur&mdash;thank God&mdash;sent away his servants,
      retired to his chamber, undressed, and went to bed. Madame, dressed only
      in a petticoat, put on her night-dress, took her prayer-book, and began,&mdash;devoutly
      enough God knows&mdash;to say her psalms and paternosters, but
      monseigneur, who was as wide awake as a rat, was anxious for a little
      conversation, and wished madame to put off saying her prayers till the
      morrow, and talk to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon me," she replied, "but I cannot talk to you now&mdash;God comes
      first you know. Nothing would go right in the house all the week if I did
      not give God what little praise I can, and I should expect bad luck if I
      did not say my prayers now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You sicken me with all this bigotry," said monseigneur. "What is the use
      of saying all these prayers? Come on, come on! and leave that business to
      the priests. Am I not right, Jehannette?" he added, addressing the damsel
      before mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur," she replied, "I do not know what to say, except that as
      madame is accustomed to serve God, let her do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there!" said madame to her husband, "I see well that you want to
      argue, and I wish to finish my prayers, so we shall not agree. I will
      leave Jehannette to talk to you, and will go to my little chamber behind
      to petition God."
    </p>
    <p>
      Monseigneur was satisfied, and madame went off at full gallop to her
      friend, the knight, who received her with God knows how great joy, and the
      honour that he did her was to bend her knees and lay her down.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you must know that whilst madame was saying her prayers with her
      lover, it happened, I know not how, that her husband begged Jehannette,
      who was keeping him company, to grant him her favours.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut matters short, by his promises and fine words she was induced to
      obey him, but the worst of it was that madame, when she returned from
      seeing her lover, who had tumbled her twice before she left, found her
      husband and Jehannette, her waiting-woman, engaged in the very same work
      which she had been performing, at which she was much astonished; and still
      more so were her husband and Jehannette at being thus surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      When madame saw that, God knows how she saluted them, though she would
      have done better to hold her tongue; and she vented her rage so on poor
      Jehannette that it seemed as though she must have a devil in her belly, or
      she could not have used such abominable words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed she did more and worse, for she picked up a big stick and laid it
      across the girl's shoulders, on seeing which, monseigneur, who was already
      vexed and angry, jumped up and so beat his wife that she could not rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having then nothing but her tongue, she used it freely God knows, but
      addressed most of her venomous speeches to poor Jehannette, who no longer
      able to bear them, told monseigneur of the goings-on of his wife, and
      where she had been to say her prayers, and with whom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The whole company was troubled&mdash;monseigneur because he had good cause
      to suspect his wife, and madame, who was wild with rage, well beaten, and
      accused by her waiting-woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      How this unfortunate household lived after that, those who know can tell.

    <h2>
      STORY THE FORTIETH &mdash; THE BUTCHER'S WIFE WHO PLAYED THE GHOST IN THE
      CHIMNEY.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Michault De Changy.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a Jacobin who left his mistress, a butcher's wife, for another
        woman who was younger and prettier, and how the said butcher's wife
        tried to enter his house by the chimney.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It happened formerly at Lille, that a famous clerk and preacher of the
      order of St. Dominic, converted, by his holy and eloquent preaching, the
      wife of a butcher; in such wise that she loved him more than all the
      world, and was never perfectly happy when he was not with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the end Master Monk tired of her, and wished that she would not
      visit him so often, at which she was as vexed as she could be, but the
      rebuff only made her love him the more.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monk, seeing that, forbade her to come to his chamber, and charged his
      clerk not to admit her, whatever she might say; at which she was more
      vexed and infuriated than ever, and small marvel.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ask me why the monk did this, I should reply that it was not from
      devotion, or a desire to lead a chaste life, but that he had made the
      acquaintance of another woman, who was prettier, much younger, and richer,
      and with whom he was on such terms that she had a key to his chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that the butcher's wife never came to him, as she had been
      accustomed, so that his new mistress could in all leisure and security
      come and gain her pardons and pay her tithe, like the women of Ostelleria,
      of whom mention has been made.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, after dinner, there was a great feast held in the chamber of
      Master Monk, and his mistress had promised to come and bring her share
      both of wine and meat. And as some of the other brothers in that monastery
      were of the same kidney, he secretly invited two or three of them; and God
      knows they had good cheer at this dinner, which did not finish without
      plenty of drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that the butcher's wife was acquainted with many of the
      servants of these preachers, and she saw them pass her house, some bearing
      wine, some pasties, some tarts, and so many other things that it was
      wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could not refrain from asking what feast was going forward at their
      house? And the answer was that all this dainties were for such an one,&mdash;that
      is to say her monk&mdash;who had some great people to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And who are they?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith! I know not," he said. "I only carry my wine to the door, and there
      our master takes it from us. I know not who is there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see," she said, "that it is a secret. Well, well! go on and do your
      duty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon there passed another servant, of whom she asked the same questions,
      and he replied as his fellow had done, but rather more, for he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe there is a damsel there;&mdash;but she wishes her presence to
      be neither seen nor known."
    </p>
    <p>
      She guessed who it was, and was in a great rage, and said to herself that
      she would keep an eye upon the woman who had robbed her of the love of her
      friend, and, no doubt, if she had met her she would have read her a pretty
      lesson, and scratched her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      She set forth with the intention of executing the plan she had conceived.
      When she arrived at the place, she waited long to meet the person she most
      hated in the world, but she had not the patience to wait till her rival
      came out of the chamber where the feast was being held, so at last she
      determined to use a ladder that a tiler, who was at work at the roof, had
      left there whilst he went to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She placed this ladder against the kitchen chimney of the house, with the
      intention of dropping in and saluting the company, for she knew well that
      she could not enter in any other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ladder being placed exactly as she wished it, she ascended it to the
      chimney, round which she tied a fairly thick cord that by chance she found
      there. Having tied that firmly, as she believed, she entered the said
      chimney and began to descend; but the worst of it was that she stuck there
      without being able to go up or down, however much she tried&mdash;and this
      was owing to her backside being so big and heavy, and to the fact that the
      cord broke, so that she could not climb back. She was in sore distress,
      God knows, and did not know what to say or do. She reflected that it would
      be better to await the arrival of the tiler, and make an appeal to him
      when he came to look for his ladder and his rope; but this hope was taken
      from her, for the tiler did not come to work until the next morning, on
      account of the heavy rain, of which she had her share, for she was quite
      drenched.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the evening grew late, the poor woman heard persons talking in the
      kitchen, whereupon she began to shout, at which they were much astonished
      and frightened, for they knew not who was calling them, or whence the
      voice came. Nevertheless, astonished as they were, they listened a little
      while, and heard the voice now in front and now behind, shrieking shrilly.
      They believed it was a spirit, and went to tell their master, who was in
      the dormitory, and was not brave enough to come and see what it was, but
      put it off till the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may guess what long hours the poor woman spent, being all night in the
      chimney. And, by bad luck, it rained heavily for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, early in the morning, the tiler came to work, to make up for
      the time the rain had made him lose on the previous day. He was quite
      astonished to find his ladder in another place than where he left it, and
      the rope tied round the chimney, and did not know who had done it. He
      determined to fetch the rope, and mounted the ladder and came to the
      chimney, and undid the cord, and put his head down the chimney, where he
      saw the butcher's wife, looking more wretched than a drowned cat, at which
      he was much astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing here, dame?" he asked. "Do you want to rob the poor
      monks who live here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, friend," she replied, "by my oath I do not. I beg of you to help me
      to get out, and I will give you whatever you ask."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do nothing of the kind," he said, "if I do not know who you are
      and whence you come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you if you like," she said, "but I beg of you not to repeat
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she told him all about her love affair with the monk, and why she had
      come there. The tiler took pity on her, and with some trouble, and by
      means of his rope, pulled her out, and brought her down to the ground. And
      she promised him that if he held his tongue she would give him beef and
      mutton enough to supply him and his family all the year, which she did.
      And the other kept the matter so secret that everybody heard of it.

    <h2>
      STORY THE FORTY-FIRST &mdash; LOVE IN ARMS.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De La Roche.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a knight who made his wife wear a hauberk whenever he would do you
        know what; and of a clerk who taught her another method which she almost
        told her husband, but turned it off suddenly.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A noble knight of Haynau, who was wise, cunning, and a great traveller,
      found such pleasure in matrimony, that after the death of his good and
      prudent wife, he could not exist long unmarried, and espoused a beautiful
      damsel of good condition, who was not one of the cleverest people in the
      world, for, to tell the truth, she was rather dull-witted, which much
      pleased her husband, because he thought he could more easily bend her to
      his will.
    </p>
    <p>
      He devoted all his time and study to training her to obey him, and
      succeeded as well as he could possibly have wished. And, amongst other
      matters, whenever he would indulge in the battle of love with her&mdash;which
      was not as often as she would have wished&mdash;he made her put on a
      splendid hauberk, at which she was at first much astonished, and asked why
      she was armed, and he replied that she could not withstand his amorous
      assaults if she were not armed. So she was content to wear the hauberk;
      and her only regret was that her husband was not more fond of making these
      assaults, for they were more trouble than pleasure to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you should ask why her lord made her wear this singular costume, I
      should reply that he hoped that the pain and inconvenience of the hauberk
      would prevent his wife from being too fond of these amorous assaults; but,
      wise as he was, he made a great mistake, for if in each love-battle the
      hauberk had broken her back and bruised her belly, she would not have
      refused to put it on, so sweet and pleasant did she find that which
      followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They thus lived together for a long time, till her husband was ordered to
      serve his prince in the war, in another sort of battle to that
      above-mentioned, so he took leave of his wife and went where he was
      ordered, and she remained at home in the charge of an old gentleman, and
      of certain damsels who served her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that there was in the house a good fellow, a clerk, who
      was treasurer of the household, and who sang and played the harp well.
      After dinner he would often play, which gave madame great pleasure, and
      she would often come to him when she heard the sound of his harp.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came so often that the clerk at last made love to her, and she, being
      desirous to put on her hauberk again, listened to his petition, and
      replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come to me at a certain time, in such a chamber, and I will give you a
      reply that will please you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was greatly thanked, and at the hour named, the clerk did not fail to
      rap at the door of the chamber the lady had indicated, where she was
      quietly awaiting him with her fine hauberk on her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the door, and the clerk saw her armed, and thinking that some
      one was concealed there to do him a mischief, was so scared that, in his
      fright, he tumbled down backwards I know not how many stairs, and might
      have broken his neck, but luckily he was not hurt, for, being in a good
      cause, God protected him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame, who saw his danger, was much vexed and displeased; she ran down
      and helped him to rise, and asked why he was in such fear? He told her
      that truly he thought he had fallen into an ambush.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have nothing to fear," she said, "I am not armed with the intention
      of doing you any hurt," and so saying they mounted the stairs together,
      and entered the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame," said the clerk, "I beg of you to tell me, if you please, why you
      have put on this hauberk?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She blushed and replied, "You know very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath, madame, begging your pardon," said he, "if I had known I
      should not have asked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband," she replied, "whenever he would kiss me, and talk of love,
      makes me dress in this way; and as I know that you have come here for that
      purpose, I prepared myself accordingly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame," he said, "you are right, and I remember now that it is the
      manner of knights to arm their ladies in this way. But clerks have another
      method, which, in my opinion is much nicer and more comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please tell me what that is," said the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will show you," he replied. Then he took off the hauberk, and the rest
      of her apparel down to her chemise, and he also undressed himself, and
      they got into the fair bed that was there, and&mdash;both being disarmed
      even of their chemises&mdash;passed two or three hours very pleasantly.
      And before leaving, the clerk showed her the method used by clerks, which
      she greatly praised, as being much better than that of knights. They often
      met afterwards, also in the same way, without its becoming known, although
      the lady was not over-cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a certain time, her husband returned from the war, at which she was
      not inwardly pleased, though outwardly she tried to pretend to be. His
      coming was known, and God knows how great a dinner was prepared. Dinner
      passed, and grace being said, the knight&mdash;to show he was a good
      fellow, and a loving husband&mdash;said to her,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go quickly to our chamber, and put on your hauberk." She, remembering the
      pleasant time she had had with her clerk, replied quickly,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, monsieur, the clerks' way is the best."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The clerks' way!" he cried. "And how do you know their way?" and he began
      to fret and to change colour, and suspect something; but he never knew the
      truth, for his suspicions were quickly dissipated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame was not such a fool but what she could see plainly that her husband
      was not pleased at what she had said, and quickly bethought herself of a
      way of getting out of the difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said that the clerks' way is the best; and I say it again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what is that?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They drink after grace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, by St. John, you speak truly!" he cried. "Verily it is their
      custom, and it is not a bad one; and since you so much care for it, we
      will keep it in future."
    </p>
    <p>
      So wine was brought and they drank it, and then Madame went to put on her
      hauberk, which she would willingly have done without, for the gentle clerk
      had showed her another way which pleased her better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, as you have heard, was Monsieur deceived by his wife's ready reply.
      No doubt her wits had been sharpened by her intercourse with the clerk,
      and after that he showed her plenty of other tricks, and in the end he and
      her husband became great friends.

      href="#linklinknote-42" name="linklinknoteref-42" id="linklinknoteref-42">42</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Meriadech.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a village clerk who being at Rome and believing that his wife was
        dead became a priest, and was appointed curé of his own town, and when
        he returned, the first person he met was his wife.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the year '50 (*) just passed, the clerk of a village in the diocese of
      Noyon, that he might gain the pardons, which as every one knows were then
      given at Rome (**), set out in company with many respectable people of
      Noyon, Compeigne, and the neighbouring places.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) 1450

     (**) Special indulgences were granted that year on account
     of the Jubilee
</pre>
    <p>
      But, before leaving, he carefully saw to his private affairs, arranged for
      the support of his wife and family, and entrusted the office of sacristan,
      which he held, to a young and worthy clerk to hold until his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a fairly brief space of time, he and his companions arrived at Rome,
      and performed their devotions and their pilgrimage as well as they knew
      how. But you must know that our clerk met, by chance, at Rome, one of his
      old school-fellows, who was in the service of a great Cardinal, and
      occupied a high position, and who was very glad to meet his old friend,
      and asked him how he was. And the other told him everything&mdash;first of
      all that he was, alas! married, how many children he had, and how that he
      was a parish clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said his friend, "by my oath! I am much grieved that you are
      married."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?" asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you," said he; "such and such a Cardinal has charged me to
      find him a secretary, a native of our province. This would have suited
      you, and you would have been largely remunerated, were it not that your
      marriage will cause you to return home, and, I fear, lose many benefits
      that you cannot now get."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath!" said the clerk, "my marriage is no great consequence, for&mdash;to
      tell you the truth&mdash;the pardon was but an excuse for getting out of
      the country, and was not the principal object of my journey; for I had
      determined to enjoy myself for two or three years in travelling about, and
      if, during that time, God should take my wife, I should only be too happy.
      So I beg and pray of you to think of me and to speak well for me to this
      Cardinal, that I may serve him; and, by my oath, I will so bear myself
      that you shall have no fault to find with me; and, moreover, you will do
      me the greatest service that ever one friend did another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since that is your wish," said his friend, "I will oblige you at once,
      and will lodge you too if you wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, friend," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut matters short, our clerk lodged with the Cardinal, and wrote and
      told his wife of his new position, and that he did not intend to return
      home as soon as he had intended when he left. She consoled herself, and
      wrote back that she would do the best she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our worthy clerk conducted himself so well in the service of the Cardinal,
      and gained such esteem, that his master had no small regret that his
      secretary was incapable of holding a living, for which he was exceedingly
      well fitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst our clerk was thus in favour, the curé of his village died, and
      thus left the living vacant during one of the Pope's months. (*) The
      Sacristan who held the place of his friend who had gone to Rome,
      determined that he would hurry to Rome as quickly as he could, and do all
      in his power to get the living for himself. He lost no time, and in a few
      days, after much trouble and fatigue, found himself at Rome, and rested
      not till he had discovered his friend&mdash;the clerk who served the
      Cardinal.
    </p>
    <p>
      After mutual salutations, the clerk asked after his wife, and the other,
      expecting to give him much pleasure and further his own interests in the
      request he was about to make, replied that she was dead&mdash;in which he
      lied, for I know that at this present moment (**) she can still worry her
      husband.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) During eight months of the year, the Pope had the right
     of bestowing all livings which became vacant.

     (**) That is when the story was written.
</pre>
    <p>
      "Do you say that my wife is dead?" cried the clerk. "May God pardon her
      all her sins."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, truly," replied the other; "the plague carried her off last year,
      along with many others."
    </p>
    <p>
      He told this lie, which cost him dear, because he knew that the clerk had
      only left home on account of his wife, who was of a quarrelsome
      disposition, and he thought the most pleasant news he could bring was to
      announce her death, and truly so it would have been, but the news was
      false.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what brings you to this country?" asked the clerk after many and
      various questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you, my friend and companion. The curé of our town is dead;
      so I came to you to ask if by any means I could obtain the benefice. I
      would beg of you to help me in this matter. I know that it is in your
      power to procure me the living, with the help of monseigneur, your
      master."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk, thinking that his wife was dead, and the cure of his native
      town vacant, thought to himself that he would snap up this living, and
      others too if he could get them. But, all the same, he said nothing to his
      friend, except that it would not be his fault if the other were not curé
      of their town,&mdash;for which he was much thanked.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened quite otherwise, for, on the morrow, our Holy Father, at the
      request of the Cardinal, the master of our clerk, gave the latter the
      living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon this clerk, when he heard the news, came to his companion, and
      said to him,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, friend, by my oath, your hopes are dissipated, at which I am much
      vexed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How so?" asked the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The cure of our town is given," he said, "but I know not to whom.
      Monseigneur, my master, tried to help you, but it was not in his power to
      accomplish it."
    </p>
    <p>
      At which the other was vexed, after he had come so far and expended so
      much. So he sorrowfully took leave of his friend, and returned to his own
      country, without boasting about the lie he had told.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let us return to our clerk, who was as merry as a grig at the news of
      the death of his wife, and to whom the benefice of his native town had
      been given, at the request of his master, by the Holy Father, as a reward
      for his services. And let us record how he became a priest at Rome, and
      chanted his first holy Mass, and took leave of his master for a time, in
      order to return and take possession of his living.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he entered the town, by ill luck the first person that he chanced to
      meet was his wife, at which he was much astonished I can assure you, and
      still more vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the meaning of this, my dear?" he asked. "They told me you were
      dead!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing of the kind," she said. "You say so, I suppose, because you wish
      it, as you have well proved, for you have left me for five years, with a
      number of young children to take care of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," he said, "I am very glad to see you in good health, and I
      praise God for it with all my heart. Cursed be he who brought me false
      news."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen!" she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I must tell you, my dear, that I cannot stay now; I am obliged to go
      in haste to the Bishop of Noyon, on a matter which concerns him; but I
      will return to you as quickly as I can."
    </p>
    <p>
      He left his wife, and took his way to Noyon; but God knows that all along
      the road he thought of his strange position.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" he said, "I am undone and dishonoured. A priest! a clerk! and
      married! I suppose I am the first miserable wretch to whom that ever
      occurred!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the Bishop of Noyon, who was much surprised at hearing his
      case, and did not know what to advise him, so sent him back to Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrived there, he related his adventure at length to his master,
      who was bitterly annoyed, and on the morrow repeated it to our Holy
      Father, in the presence of the Sacred College and all the Cardinals.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was ordered that he should remain priest, and married, and curé
      also; and that he should live with his wife as a married man, honourably
      and without reproach, and that his children should be legitimate and not
      bastards, although their father was a priest. Moreover, that if it was
      found he lived apart from his wife, he should lose the living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, as you have heard, was this gallant punished for believing the false
      news of his friend, and was obliged to go and live in his own parish, and,
      which was worse, with his wife, with whose company he would have gladly
      dispensed if the Church had not ordered it otherwise.

    <h2>
      STORY THE FORTY-THIRD &mdash; A BARGAIN IN HORNS.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Fiennes.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a labourer who found a man with his wife, and forwent his revenge
        for a certain quantity of wheat, but his wife insisted that he should
        complete the work he had begun.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      There lived formerly, in the district of Lille, a worthy man who was a
      labourer and tradesman, and who managed, by the good offices of himself
      and his friends, to obtain for a wife a very pretty young girl, but who
      was not rich, neither was her husband, but he was very covetous, and
      diligent in business, and loved to gain money.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she, for her part, attended to the household as her husband desired;
      who therefore had a good opinion of her, and often went about his business
      without any suspicion that she was other than good.
    </p>
    <p>
      But whilst the poor man thus came and went, and left his wife alone, a
      good fellow came to her, and, to cut the story short, was in a short time
      the deputy for the trusting husband, who still believed that he had the
      best wife in the world, and the one who most thought about the increase of
      his honour and his worldly wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not so, for she gave him not the love she owed him, and cared not
      whether he had profit or loss by her. The good merchant aforesaid, being
      out as usual, his wife soon informed her friend, who did not fail to come
      as he was desired, at once. And not to lose his time, he approached his
      mistress, and made divers amorous proposals to her, and in short the
      desired pleasure was not refused him any more than on the former
      occasions, which had not been few.
    </p>
    <p>
      By bad luck, whilst the couple were thus engaged, the husband arrived, and
      found them at work, and was much astonished, for he did not know that his
      wife was a woman of that sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this?" he said. "By God's death, scoundrel, I will kill you on
      the spot."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other, who had been caught in the act, and was much scared, knew not
      what to say, but as he was aware that the husband was miserly and
      covetous, he said quickly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, John, my friend, I beg your mercy; pardon me if I have done you any
      wrong, and on my word I will give you six bushels of wheat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God!" said he, "I will do nothing of the kind. You shall die by my
      hands and I will have your life if I do not have twelve bushels."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good wife, who heard this dispute, in order to restore peace, came
      forward, and said to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, dear, let him finish what he has begun, I beg, and you shall have
      eight bushels. Shall he not?" she added, turning to her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am satisfied," he said, "though on my oath it is too much, seeing how
      dear corn is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is too much?" said the good man. "Morbleu! I much regret that I did
      not say more, for you would have to pay a much heavier fine if you were
      brought to justice: however, make up your mind that I will have twelve
      bushels, or you shall die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, John," said his wife, "you are wrong to contradict me. It seems to
      me that you ought to be satisfied with eight bushels, for you know that is
      a large quantity of wheat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Say no more," he replied, "I will have twelve bushels, or I will kill him
      and you too."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil," quoth the lover; "you drive a bargain; but at least, if I
      must pay you, let me have time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I agree to, but I will have my twelve bushels."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dispute ended thus, and it was agreed that he was to pay in two
      instalments,&mdash;six bushels on the morrow, and the others on St. Remy's
      day, then near.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was arranged by the wife, who then said to her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are satisfied, are you not, to receive your wheat in the manner I
      have said?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then go," she said, "whilst he finishes the work he had begun when you
      interrupted him; otherwise the contract will not be binding."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John! is it so?" said the lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I always keep my word," said the good merchant. "By God, no man shall say
      I am a cheat or a liar. You will finish the job you have begun, and I am
      to have my twelve bushels of wheat on the terms agreed. That was our
      contract&mdash;was it not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, truly," said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good bye, then," said the husband, "but at any rate be sure that I have
      six bushels of wheat to-morrow."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
"Don't be afraid," said the other. "I will keep my word." So the good
man left the house, quite joyful that he was to have twelve bushels of
wheat, and his wife and her lover recommenced more heartily than ever. I
have heard that the wheat was duly delivered on the dates agreed.

    <h2>
      STORY THE FORTY-FOURTH &mdash; THE MATCH-MAKING PRIEST.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De La Roche.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a village priest who found a husband for a girl with whom he was
        in love, and who had promised him that when she was married she would do
        whatever he wished, of which he reminded her on the wedding-day, and the
        husband heard it, and took steps accordingly, as you will hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the present day they are many priests and curés who are good fellows,
      and who can as easily commit follies and imprudences as laymen can.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a pretty village of Picardy, there lived formerly a curé of a lecherous
      disposition. Amongst the other pretty girls and women of his parish, he
      cast eyes on a young and very pretty damsel of nubile age, and was bold
      enough to tell her what he wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Won over by his fair words, and the hundred thousand empty promises he
      made, she was almost ready to listen to his requests, which would have
      been a great pity, for she was a nice and pretty girl with pleasant
      manners, and had but one fault,&mdash;which was that she was not the most
      quick-witted person in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know why it occurred to her to answer him in that manner, but one
      day she told the curé, when he was making hot love to her, that she was
      not inclined to do what he required until she was married, for if by
      chance, as happened every day, she had a baby, she would always be
      dishonoured and reproached by her father, mother, brothers, and all her
      family, which she could not bear, nor had she strength to sustain the
      grief and worry which such a misfortune would entail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nevertheless, if some day I am married, speak to me again, and I will do
      what I can for you, but not otherwise; so give heed to what I say and
      believe me once for all."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cure was not over-pleased at this definite reply, bold and sensible as
      it was, but he was so amorous that he would not abandon all hope, and said
      to the girl;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you so firmly decided, my dear, not to do anything for me until you
      are married?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, I am," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if you are married, and I am the means and the cause, you will
      remember it afterwards, and honestly and loyally perform what you have
      promised?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath, yes," she said, "I promise you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," he said, "make your mind easy, for I promise you faithfully
      that if you are not married soon it will not be for want of efforts or
      expense on my part, for I am sure that you cannot desire it more than I
      do; and in order to prove that I am devoted to you soul and body, you will
      see how I will manage this business."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, monsieur le curé," she said, "we shall see what you will do."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that she took leave of him, and the good curé, who was madly in love
      with her, was not satisfied till he had seen her father. He talked over
      various matters with him, and at last the worthy priest spoke to the old
      man about his daughter, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neighbour, I am much astonished, as also are many of your neighbours and
      friends, that you do not let your daughter marry. Why do you keep her at
      home when you know how dangerous it is? Not that&mdash;God forbid&mdash;I
      say, or wish to say, that she is not virtuous, but every day we see girls
      go wrong because they do not marry at the proper age. Forgive me for so
      openly stating my opinion, but the respect I have for you, and the duty I
      owe you as your unworthy pastor, require and compel me to tell you this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the Lord, monsieur le curé," said the good man, "I know that your
      words are quite true, and I thank you for them, and do not think that I
      have kept her so long at home from any selfish motive, for if her welfare
      is concerned I will do all I can for her, as I ought. You would not wish,
      nor is it usual, that I should buy a husband for her, but if any
      respectable young man should come along, I will do everything that a good
      father should."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well said," replied the curé, "and on my word, you could not do better
      than marry her off quickly. It is a great thing to be able to see your
      grandchildren round you before you become too old. What do you say to
      so-and-so, the son of your neighbour?&mdash;He seems to me a good,
      hard-working man, who would make a good husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John!" said the old man, "I have nothing but good to say about
      him. For my own part, I know him to be a good young man and a good worker.
      His father and mother, and all his relatives, are respectable people, and
      if they do me the honour to ask my daughter's hand in marriage for him, I
      shall reply in a manner that will satisfy them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could not say more," replied the curé, "and, if it please God, the
      matter shall be arranged as I wish, and as I know for a fact that this
      marriage would be to the benefit of both parties, I will do my best to
      farther it, and with this I will now say farewell to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      If the curé had played his part well with the girl's father, he was quite
      as clever in regard to the father of the young man. He began with a
      preamble to the effect that his son was of an age to marry, and ought to
      settle down, and brought a hundred thousand reasons to show that the world
      would be lost if his son were not soon married.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur le curé," replied also the second old man, "there is much truth
      in what you say, and if I were now as well off as I was, I know not how
      many years ago, he would not still be unmarried; for there is nothing in
      the world I desire more than to see him settled, but want of money has
      prevented it, and so he must have patience until the Lord sends us more
      wealth than we have at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then," said the curé, "if I understand you aright, it is only money that
      is wanting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith! that is so," said the old man. "If I had now as much as I had
      formerly, I should soon seek a wife for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have concerned myself," said the curé, "because I desire the welfare
      and prosperity of your son, and find that the daughter of such an one
      (that is to say his ladylove) would exactly suit him. She is pretty and
      virtuous, and her father is well off, and, as I know, would give some
      assistance, and&mdash;which is no small matter&mdash;is a wise man of good
      counsel, and a friend to whom you and your son could have recourse. What
      do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly," said the good man, "if it please God that my son should be
      fortunate enough to be allied to such a good family; and if I thought that
      he could anyhow succeed in that, I would get together what money I could,
      and would go round to all my friends, for I am sure that he could never
      find anyone more suitable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have not chosen badly then," said the curé. "And what would you say if
      I spoke about this matter to her father, and conducted it to its desired
      end, and, moreover, lent you twenty francs for a certain period that we
      could arrange?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath, monsieur le curé," said the good man, "you offer me more than
      I deserve. If you did this, you would render a great service to me and
      mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly," answered the curé, "I have not said anything that I do not mean
      to perform; so be of good cheer, for I hope to see this matter at an end."
    </p>
    <p>
      To shorten matters, the curé, hoping to have the woman when once she was
      married, arranged the matter so well that, with the twenty francs he lent,
      the marriage was settled, and the wedding day arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it is the custom that the bride and bridegroom confess on that day.
      The bridegroom came first, and when he had finished, he withdrew to a
      little distance saying his orisons and his paternosters. Then came the
      bride, who knelt down before the curé and confessed. When she had said all
      she had to say, he spoke to her in turn, and so loudly, that the
      bridegroom, who was not far off, heard every word, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I beg you to remember now the promise you formerly made me. You
      promised me that when you were married that I should ride you; and now you
      are married, thank God, by my means and endeavours, and through the money
      that I have lent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur le curé," she said, "have no fear but what I will keep the
      promise I have made, if God so please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," he replied, and then gave her absolution after this devout
      confession, and suffered her to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridegroom, who had heard these words, was not best pleased, but
      nevertheless thought it not the right moment to show his vexation.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all the ceremonies at the church were over, the couple returned
      home, and bed-time drew near. The bridegroom whispered to a friend of his
      whom he dearly loved, to fetch a big handful of birch rods, and hide them
      secretly under the bed, and this the other did.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came, the bride went to bed, as is the custom, and kept to
      the edge of the bed, and said not a word. The bridegroom came soon after,
      and lay on the other edge of the bed without approaching her, or saying a
      word and in the morning he rose without doing anything else, and hid his
      rods again under the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had left the room, there came several worthy matrons who found the
      bride in bed, and asked her how the night had passed, and what she thought
      of her husband?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith!" she said, "there was his place over there"&mdash;pointing to the
      edge of the bed&mdash;"and here was mine. He never came near me, and I
      never went near him."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all much astonished, and did not know what to think, but at last
      they agreed that if he had not touched her, it was from some religious
      motive, and they thought no more of it for that once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second night came, and the bride lay down in the place she had
      occupied the previous night, and the bridegroom, still furnished with his
      rods, did the same and nothing more; and this went on for two more nights,
      at which the bride was much displeased, and did not fail to tell the
      matrons the next day, who knew not what to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is to be feared he is not a man, for he has continued four nights in
      that manner. He must be told what he has to do; so if to-night he does not
      begin,"&mdash;they said to the bride&mdash;"draw close to him and cuddle
      and kiss him, and ask him if married people do not do something else
      besides? And if he should ask you what you want him to do? tell him that
      you want him to ride you, and you will hear what he will say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do so," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      She failed not, for that night she lay in her usual place, and her husband
      took up his old quarters, and made no further advances than he had on the
      previous nights. So she turned towards him, and throwing her arms round
      him, said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here husband! Is this the pleasant time I was to expect? This is the
      fifth night I have slept with you, and you have not deigned to come near
      me! On my word I should never have wished to be married if I had not
      thought married people did something else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what did they tell you married people did?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say," she replied, "that the one rides the other. I want you to ride
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ride!" he said. "I would not like to do that.&mdash;I would not be so
      unkind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I beg of you to do it&mdash;for that is what married people do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want me to do it?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg of you to do it," she said, and so saying she kissed him tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath!" he said, "I will do it, since you ask me to though much to
      my regret, for I am sure that you will not like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without saying another word he took his stock of rods, and stripped his
      wife, and thrashed her soundly, back and belly, legs and thighs, till she
      was bathed in blood. She screamed, she cried, she struggled, and it was
      piteous to see her, and she cursed the moment that she had ever asked to
      be ridden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you so," said her husband, and then took her in his arms and
      "rode" her so nicely that she forgot the pain of the beating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you call that you have just done?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is called," he said, "'to blow up the backside'."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blow up the backside!" she said. "The expression is not so pretty as 'to
      ride', but the operation is much nicer, and, now that I have learned the
      difference, I shall know what to ask for in future."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that the curé was always on the look-out for when the
      newly married bride should come to church, to remind her of her promise.
      The first time she appeared, he sidled up to the font, and when she passed
      him, he gave her holy water, and said in a low voice,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear! you promised me that I should ride you when you were married!
      You are married now, thank God, and it is time to think when and how you
      will keep your word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ride?" she said. "By God, I would rather see you hanged or drowned! Don't
      talk to me about riding. But I will let you blow up my backside if you
      like!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And catch your quartain fever!" said the curé, "beastly dirty,
      ill-mannered whore that you are! Am I to be rewarded after all I have done
      for you, by being permitted to blow up your backside!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So the curé went off in a huff, and the bride took her seat that she might
      hear the holy Mass, which the good curé was about to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus, in the manner which you have just heard, did the curé lose his
      chance of enjoying the girl, by his own fault and no other's, because he
      spoke too loudly to her the day when he confessed her, for her husband
      prevented him, in the way described above, by making his wife believe that
      the act of 'riding' was called 'to blow up the backside'.

      STORY THE FORTY-FIFTH &mdash; THE SCOTSMAN TURNED WASHERWOMAN
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De La Roche.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a young Scotsman who was disguised as a woman for the space of
        fourteen years, and by that means slept with many girls and married
        women, but was punished in the end, as you will hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      None of the preceding stories have related any incidents which happened in
      Italy, but only those which occurred in France, Germany, England,
      Flanders, and Brabant,&mdash;therefore I will relate, as something new, an
      incident which formerly happened in Rome, and was as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Rome was a Scotsman of the age of about 22, who for the space of
      fourteen years had disguised himself as a woman, without it being publicly
      known all that time that he was a man. He called himself Margaret, and
      there was hardly a good house in Rome where he was not known, and he was
      specially welcomed by all the women, such as waiting-women, and wenches of
      the lower orders, and also many of the greatest ladies in Rome.
    </p>
    <p>
      This worthy Scotsman carried on the trade of laundress, and had learned to
      bleach sheets, and called himself the washerwoman, and under that pretence
      frequented, as has been said, all the best houses in Rome, for there was
      no woman who could bleach sheets as he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you must know that he did much else beside, for when he found himself
      with some pretty girl, he showed her that he was a man. Often, in order to
      prepare the lye, he stopped one or two nights in the aforesaid houses, and
      they made him sleep with the maid, or sometimes with the daughter; and
      very often, if her husband were not there, the mistress would have his
      company. And God knows that he had a good time, and, thanks to the way he
      employed his body, was welcome everywhere, and many wenches and waiting
      maids would fight as to who was to have him for a bedfellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The citizens of Rome heard such a good account of him from their wives,
      that they willingly welcomed him to their houses, and if they went abroad,
      were glad to have Margaret to keep house along with their wives, and, what
      is more, made her sleep with them, so good and honest was she esteemed, as
      has been already said.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the space of fourteen years did Margaret continue this way of living,
      but the mischief was at last brought to light by a young girl, who told
      her father that she had slept with Margaret and been assaulted by her, and
      that in reality she was a man. The father informed the officers of
      justice, and it was found that she had all the members and implements that
      men carry, and, in fact, was a man and not a woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was ordered that he should be put in a cart and led through all the
      city of Rome, and at every street corner his genitals should be exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done, and God knows how ashamed and vexed poor Margaret was. But
      you must know that when the cart stopped at a certain corner, and all the
      belongings of Margaret were being exhibited, a Roman said out loud;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at that scoundrel! he has slept more than twenty nights with my
      wife!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Many others said the same, and many who did not say it knew it well, but,
      for their honours sake, held their tongue. Thus, in the manner you have
      heard, was the poor Scotsman punished for having pretended to be a woman,
      and after that punishment was banished from Rome; at which the women were
      much displeased, for never was there such a good laundress, and they were
      very sorry that they had so unfortunately lost her.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Thianges (*).
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a Jacobin and a nun, who went secretly to an orchard to enjoy
        pleasant pastime under a pear-tree; in which tree was hidden one who
        knew of the assignation, and who spoiled their sport for that time, as
        you will hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) The name of the author of this story is spelled in four
     different ways in different editions of these tales&mdash;Viz,
     Thieurges, Thienges, Thieuges and Thianges.
</pre>
    <p>
      It is no means unusual for monks to run after nuns. Thus it happened
      formerly that a Jacobin so haunted, visited, and frequented a nunnery in
      this kingdom, that his intention became known,&mdash;which was to sleep
      with one of the ladies there.
    </p>
    <p>
      And God knows how anxious and diligent he was to see her whom he loved
      better than all the rest of the world, and continued to visit there so
      often, that the Abbess and many of the nuns perceived how matters stood,
      at which they were much displeased. Nevertheless, to avoid scandal, they
      said not a word to the monk, but gave a good scolding to the nun, who made
      many excuses, but the abbess, who was clear-sighted, knew by her replies
      and excuses that she was guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, on account of that nun, the Abbess restrained the liberty of all, and
      caused the doors of the cloisters and other places to be closed, so that
      the poor Jacobin could by no means come to his mistress. That greatly
      vexed him, and her also, I need not say, and you may guess that they
      schemed day and night by what means they could meet; but could devise no
      plan, such a strict watch did the Abbess keep on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened one day, that one of the nieces of the Abbess was married, and
      a great feast was made in the convent. There was a great assemblage of
      people from the country round, and the Abbess was very busy receiving the
      great people who had come to do honour to her niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy Jacobin thought that he might get a glimpse of his mistress,
      and by chance be lucky enough to find an opportunity to speak to her. He
      came therefore, and found what he sought; for, because of the number of
      guests, the Abbess was prevented from keeping watch over the nun, and he
      had an opportunity to tell his mistress his griefs, and how much he
      regretted the good time that had passed; and she, who greatly loved him,
      gladly listened to him, and would have willingly made him happy. Amongst
      other speeches, he said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! my dear, you know that it is long since we have had a quiet talk
      together such as we like; I beg of you therefore, if it is possible,
      whilst everyone is otherwise engaged than in watching us, to tell me where
      we can have a few words apart."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So help me God, my friend," she replied, "I desire it no less than you
      do. But I do not know of any place where it can be done; for there are so
      many people in the house, and I cannot enter my chamber, there are so many
      strangers who have come to this wedding; but I will tell you what you can
      do. You know the way to the great garden; do you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John! yes," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the corner of the garden," she said, "there is a nice paddock enclosed
      with high and thick hedges, and in the middle is a large pear-tree, which
      makes the place cool and shady. Go there and wait for me, and as soon as I
      can get away, I will hurry to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jacobin greatly thanked her and went straight there. But you must know
      there was a young gallant who had come to the feast, who was standing not
      far from these lovers and had heard their conversation, and, as he knew
      the paddock, he determined that he would go and hide there, and see their
      love-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped out of the crowd, and as fast as his feet could carry him, ran
      to this paddock, and arrived there before the Jacobin; and when he came
      there, he climbed into the great pear-tree&mdash;which had large branches,
      and was covered with leaves and pears,&mdash;and hid himself so well that
      he could not be easily seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was hardly ensconced there when there came trotting along the worthy
      Jacobin, looking behind him to see if his mistress was following; and God
      knows that he was glad to find himself in that beautiful spot, and never
      lifted his eyes to the pear-tree, for he never suspected that there was
      anyone there, but kept his eyes on the road by which he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked until he saw his mistress coming hastily, and she was soon with
      him, and they rejoiced greatly, and the good Jacobin took off his gown and
      his scapulary, and kissed and cuddled tightly the fair nun.
    </p>
    <p>
      They wanted to do that for which they came thither, and prepared
      themselves accordingly, and in so doing the nun said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardieu, Brother Aubrey, I would have you know that you are about to
      enjoy one of the prettiest nuns in the Church. You can judge for yourself.
      Look what breasts Î what a belly! what thighs! and all the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath," said Brother Aubrey, "Sister Jehanne, my darling, you also
      can say that you have for a lover one of the best-looking monks of our
      Order, and as well furnished as any man in this kingdom," and with these
      words, taking in his hand the weapon with which he was about to fight, he
      brandished it before his lady's eyes, and cried, "What do you say? What do
      you think of it? Is it not a handsome one? Is it not worthy of a pretty
      girl?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly it is," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you shall have it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you shall have," said he who was up in the pear-tree, "all the best
      pears on the tree;" and with that he took and shook the branches with both
      hands, and the pears rattled down on them and on the ground, at which
      Brother Aubrey was so frightened that he hardly had the sense to pick up
      his gown, but ran away as fast as he could without waiting, and did not
      feel safe till he was well away from the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nun was as much, or more, frightened, but before she could set off,
      the gallant had come down out of the tree, and taking her by the hand,
      prevented her leaving, and said; "My dear, you must not go away thus: you
      must first pay the fruiterer."
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that a refusal would appear unseasonable, and was fain to let the
      fruiterer complete the work which Brother Aubrey had left undone.

      href="#linklinknote-47" name="linklinknoteref-47" id="linklinknoteref-47">47</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De La Roche.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a President who knowing of the immoral conduct of his wife, caused
        her to be drowned by her mule, which had been kept without drink for a
        week, and given salt to eat&mdash;as is more clearly related hereafter.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In Provence there lived formerly a President of great and high renown, who
      was a most learned clerk and prudent man, valiant in arms, discreet in
      counsel, and, in short, had all the advantages which man could enjoy. (*)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) Though not mentioned here by name, the principal
     character in this story has been identified with Chaffrey
     Carles, President of the Parliament of Grenoble. On the
     front of a house in the Rue de Cleres, in Grenoble is carved
     a coat of arms held by an angel who has her finger on her
     lips. The arms are those of the Carles family and the figure
     is supposed to refer to this story. At any rate the secret
     was very badly kept, for the story seems to have been widely
     known within a few years of its occurrence.
</pre>
    <p>
      One thing only was wanting to him, and that was the one that vexed him
      most, and with good cause&mdash;and it was that he had a wife who was far
      from good. The good lord saw and knew that his wife was unfaithful, and
      inclined to play the whore, but the sense that God had given him, told him
      that there was no remedy except to hold his tongue or die, for he had
      often both seen and read that nothing would cure a woman of that
      complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, at any rate, you may imagine that a man of courage and virtue, as he
      was, was far from happy, and that his misfortune rankled in his sorrowing
      heart. Yet as he outwardly appeared to know or see nothing of his wife's
      misconduct, one of his servants came to him one day when he was alone in
      his chamber, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, I want to inform you, as I ought, of something which
      particularly touches your honour. I have watched your wife's conduct, and
      I can assure you that she does not keep the faith she promised, for a
      certain person (whom he named) occupies your place very often."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good President, who knew as well or better than the servant who made
      the report, how his wife behaved, replied angrily;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! scoundrel, I am sure that you lie in all you say! I know my wife too
      well, and she is not what you say&mdash;no! Do you think I keep you to
      utter lies about a wife who is good and faithful to me! I will have no
      more of you; tell me what I owe you and then go, and never enter my sight
      again if you value your life!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor servant, who thought he was doing his master a great service,
      said how much was due to him, received his money and went, but the
      President, seeing that the unfaithfulness became more and more evident,
      was as vexed and troubled as he could be. He could not devise any plan by
      which he could honestly get rid of her, but it happened that God willed,
      or fortune permitted that his wife was going to a wedding shortly, and he
      thought it might be made to turn out lucky for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to the servant who had charge of the horses, and a fine mule that
      he had, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care that you give nothing to drink to my mule either night or day,
      until I give you further orders, and whenever you give it its hay, mix a
      good handful of salt with it&mdash;but do not say a word about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will say nothing," said the servant, "and I will do whatever you
      command me."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the wedding day of the cousin of the President's wife drew near, she
      said to her husband,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur, if it be your pleasure, I would willingly attend the wedding of
      my cousin, which will take place next Sunday, at such a place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, my dear; I am satisfied: go, and God guide you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, monsieur," she replied, "but I know not exactly how to go. I
      do not wish to take my carriage; your nag is so skittish that I am afraid
      to undertake the journey on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my dear, take my mule&mdash;it looks well, goes nicely and quietly,
      and is more sure-footed than any animal I ever saw."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith!" she said, "I thank you: you are a good husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      The day of departure arrived, and all the servants of Madame were ready,
      and also the women who were to serve her and accompany her, and two or
      three cavaliers who were to escort Madame, and they asked if Madame were
      also ready, and she informed them that she would come at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she was dressed, she came down, and they brought her the mule which
      had not drank for eight days, and was mad with thirst, so much salt had it
      eaten. When she was mounted, the cavaliers went first, making their horses
      caracole, and thus did all the company pass through the town into the
      country, and on till they came to a defile through which the great river
      Rhone rushes with marvellous swiftness. And when the mule which had drank
      nothing for eight days saw the river, it sought neither bridge nor ford,
      but made one leap into the river with its load, which was the precious
      body of Madame.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the attendants saw the accident, but they could give no help; so was
      Madame drowned, which was a great misfortune. And the mule, when it had
      drunk its fill, swam across the Rhone till it reached the shore, and was
      saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      All were much troubled and sorrowful that Madame was lost, and they
      returned to the town. One of the servants went to the President, who was
      in his room expecting the news; and with much sorrow told him of the death
      of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good President, who in his heart was more glad than sorry, showed
      great contrition, and fell down, and displayed much sorrow and regret for
      his good wife. He cursed the mule, and the wedding to which his wife was
      going.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And by God!" he said, "it is a great reproach to all you people that were
      there that you did not save my poor wife, who loved you all so much; you
      are all cowardly wretches, and you have clearly shown it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant excused himself, as did the others also, as well as they
      could, and left the President, who praised God with uplifted hands that he
      was rid of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave his wife's body a handsome funeral, but&mdash;as you may imagine&mdash;although
      he was of a fit and proper age, he took care never to marry again, lest he
      should once more incur the same misfortune.

    <h2>
      STORY THE FORTY-EIGHTH &mdash; THE CHASTE MOUTH.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De La Roche.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a woman who would not suffer herself to be kissed, though she
        willingly gave up all the rest of her body except the mouth, to her
        lover&mdash;and the reason that she gave for this.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A noble youth fell in love with a young damsel who was married, and when
      he had made her acquaintance, told her, as plainly as he could, his case,
      and declared that he was ill for love of her,&mdash;and, to tell truth, he
      was much smitten.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened to him graciously enough, and after their first interview, he
      left well satisfied with the reply he had received. But if he had been
      love sick before he made the avowal, he was still more so afterwards. He
      could not sleep night or day for thinking of his mistress, and by what
      means he could gain her favour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the charge when he saw his opportunity, and God knows, if
      he spoke well the first time, he played his part still better on the
      second occasion, and, by good luck, he found his mistress not disinclined
      to grant his request,&mdash;at which he was in no small degree pleased.
      And as he had not always the time or leisure to come and see her, he told
      her on that occasion of the desire he had to do her a service in any
      manner that he could, and she thanked him and was as kind as could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, he found in her so great courtesy, and kindness, and fair words,
      that he could not reasonably expect more, and thereupon wished to kiss,
      but she refused point-blank; nor could he even obtain a kiss when he said
      farewell, at which he was much astonished.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had left her, he doubted much whether he should ever gain her
      love, seeing that he could not obtain a single kiss, but he comforted
      himself by remembering the loving words she had said when they parted, and
      the hope she had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He again laid siege to her; in short, came and went so often, that his
      mistress at last gave him a secret assignation, where they could say all
      that they had to say, in private. And when he took leave of her, he
      embraced her gently and would have kissed her, but she defended herself
      vigorously, and said to him, harshly;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go away, go away! and leave me alone! I do not want to be kissed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He excused his conduct as he best could, and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this?" he said to himself. "I have never seen a woman like that!
      She gives me the best possible reception, and has already given me all
      that I have dared to ask&mdash;yet I cannot obtain one poor, little kiss."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the appointed time, he went to the place his mistress had named, and
      did at his leisure that for which he came, for he lay in her arms all one
      happy night, and did whatsoever he wished, except kiss her, and that he
      could never manage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand these manners," he said to himself; "this woman lets
      me sleep with her, and do whatever I like to her; but I have no more
      chance of getting a single kiss than I have of finding the true Cross!
      Morbleu! I cannot make it out; there is some mystery about it, and I must
      find out what it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when they were enjoying themselves, and were both gay, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I beg of you to tell me the reason why you invariably refuse to
      give me a kiss? You have graciously allowed me to enjoy all your fair and
      sweet body&mdash;and yet you refuse me a little kiss!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith! my friend," she replied, "as you say, a kiss I have always refused
      you,&mdash;so never expect it, for you will never get it. There is a very
      good reason for that, as I will tell you. It is true that when I married
      my husband, I promised him&mdash;with the mouth only&mdash;many fine
      things. And since it is my mouth that swore and promised to be chaste, I
      will keep it for him, and would rather die than let anyone else touch it&mdash;it
      belongs to him and no other, and you must not expect to have anything to
      do with it. But my backside has never promised or sworn anything to him;
      do with that and the rest of me&mdash;my mouth excepted&mdash;whatever you
      please; I give it all to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her lover laughed loudly, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, dearest! You say well, and I am greatly pleased that you are
      honest enough to keep your promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God forbid," she answered, "that I should ever break it."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in the manner that you have heard, was this woman shared between them;
      the husband, had the mouth only, and her lover all the rest, and if, by
      chance, the husband ever used any other part of her, it was rather by way
      of a loan, for they belonged to the lover by gift of the said woman. But
      at all events the husband had this advantage, that his wife was content to
      let him have the use of that which she had given to her lover; but on no
      account would she permit the lover to enjoy that which she had bestowed
      upon her husband.

    <h2>
      STORY THE FORTY-NINTH &mdash; THE SCARLET BACKSIDE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Pierre David.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of one who saw his wife with a man to whom she gave the whole of her
        body, except her backside, which she left for her husband and he made
        her dress one day when his friends were present in a woollen gown on the
        backside of which was a piece of fine scarlet, and so left her before
        all their friends.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I am well aware that formerly there lived in the city of Arras, a worthy
      merchant, who had the misfortune to have married a wife who was not the
      best woman in the world, for, when she saw a chance, she would slip as
      easily as an old cross-bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good merchant suspected his wife's misdeeds, and was also informed by
      several of his friends and neighbours. Thereupon he fell into a great
      frenzy and profound melancholy; which did not mend matters. Then he
      determined to try whether he could know for certain that which was hardly
      likely to please him&mdash;that is to see one or more of those who were
      his deputies come to his house to visit his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      So one day he pretended to go out, and hid himself in a chamber of his
      house of which he alone had the key. The said chamber looked upon the
      street and the courtyard, and by several secret openings and chinks upon
      several other chambers in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the good woman thought her husband had gone, she let one of the
      lovers who used to come to her know of it, and he obeyed the summons as he
      should, for he followed close on the heels of the wench who was sent to
      fetch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband, who as has been said, was in his secret chamber, saw the man
      who was to take his place enter the house, but he said not a word, for he
      wished to know more if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the lover was in the house, the lady led him by the hand into her
      chamber, conversing all the while. Then she locked the door, and they
      began to kiss and to cuddle, and enjoy themselves, and the good woman
      pulled off her gown and appeared in a plain petticoat, and her companion
      threw his arms round her, and did that for which he came. The poor
      husband, meanwhile, saw all this through a little grating, and you may
      imagine was not very comfortable; he was even so close to them that he
      could hear plainly all they said. When the battle between the good woman
      and her lover was over, they sat upon a couch that was in the chamber, and
      talked of various matters. And as the lover looked upon his mistress, who
      was marvellously fair, he began to kiss her again, and as he kissed her he
      said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Darling, to whom does this sweet mouth belong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is yours, sweet friend," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you. And these beautiful eyes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yours also," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this fair rounded bosom-does that belong to me?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, by my oath, to you and none other," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards he put his hand upon her belly, and upon her "front" and each
      time asked, "Whose is this, darling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is no need to ask; you know well enough that it is all yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he put his hand upon her big backside, and asked smiling,
    </p>
    <p>
      "And whose is this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my husband's," she said. "That is his share; but all the rest is
      yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly," he said, "I thank you greatly. I cannot complain, for you have
      given me all the best parts. On the other hand, be assured that I am yours
      entirely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I well know it," she said, and with that the combat of love began again
      between them, and more vigorously than ever, and that being finished, the
      lover left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor husband, who had seen and heard everything, could stand no more;
      he was in a terrible rage, nevertheless he suppressed his wrath, and the
      next day appeared, as though he had just come back from a journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner that day, he said that he wished to give a great feast on the
      following Sunday to her father and mother, and such and such of her
      relations and cousins, and that she was to lay in great store of
      provisions that they might enjoy themselves that day. She promised to do
      this and to invite the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday came, the dinner was prepared, those who were bidden all appeared,
      and each took the place the host designated, but the merchant remained
      standing, and so did his wife, until the first course was served.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first course was placed on the table, the merchant who had
      secretly caused to be made for his wife a robe of thick duffle grey with a
      large patch of scarlet cloth on the backside, said to his wife, "Come with
      me to the bedroom."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked first, and she followed him. When they were there, he made her
      take off her gown, and showing her the aforesaid gown of duffle grey,
      said, "Put on this dress!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked, and saw that it was made of coarse stuff, and was much
      surprised, and could not imagine why her husband wished her to dress in
      this manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For what purpose do you wish me to put this on?" she asked. "Never mind,"
      he replied, "I wish you to wear it." "Faith!" she replied, "I don't like
      it! I won't put it on! Are you mad? Do you want all your people and mine
      to laugh at us both?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mad or sane," he said, "you will wear it." "At least," she answered, "let
      me know why." "You will know that in good time." In short, she was
      compelled to put on this gown, which had a very strange appearance, and in
      this apparel she was led to the table, where most of her relations and
      friends were seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you imagine they were very astonished to see her thus dressed, and, as
      you may suppose, she was very much ashamed, and would not have come to the
      table if she had not been compelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of her relatives said they had the right to know the meaning of this
      strange apparel, but her husband replied that they were to enjoy their
      dinner, and afterwards they should know.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman who was dressed in this strange garb could eat but little;
      there was a mystery connected with the gown which oppressed her spirits.
      She would have been even more troubled if she had known the meaning of the
      scarlet patch, but she did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner was at length over, the table was removed, grace was said, and
      everyone stood up. Then the husband came forward and began to speak, and
      said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "All you who are here assembled, I will, if you wish, tell you briefly why
      I have called you together, and why I have dressed my wife in this
      apparel. It is true that I had been informed that your relative here kept
      but ill the vows she had made to me before the priest, nevertheless I
      would not lightly believe that which was told me, but wished to learn the
      truth for myself, and six days ago I pretended to go abroad, and hid
      myself in an upstairs chamber. I had scarcely come there before there
      arrived a certain man, whom my wife led into her chamber, where they did
      whatsoever best pleased them. And amongst other questions, the man
      demanded of her to whom belonged her mouth, her eyes, her hands, her
      belly, her 'front', and her thighs? And she replied, '<i>To you, dear</i>'.
      And when he came to her backside, he asked, '<i>And whose is this,
      darling?</i>' '<i>My husband's</i>' she replied. Therefore I have dressed
      her thus. She said that only her backside was mine, and I have caused it
      it to be attired as becomes my condition. The rest of her have I clad in
      the garb which is befitting an unfaithful and dishonoured woman, for such
      she is, and as such I give her back to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The company was much astonished to hear this speech, and the poor woman
      overcome with shame. She never again occupied a position in her husband's
      house, but lived, dishonoured and ashamed, amongst her own people.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Anthoine De La Sale.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a father who tried to kill his son because the young man wanted to
        lie with his grandmother, and the reply made by the said son.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Young men like to travel and to seek after adventures; and thus it was
      with the son of a labourer, of Lannoys, who from the age of ten until he
      was twenty-six, was away from home; and from his departure until his
      return, his father and mother heard no news of him, so they often thought
      that he was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned at last, and God knows what joy there was in the house, and
      how he was feasted to the best of such poor means as God had given them.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the one who most rejoiced to see him was his grandmother, his father's
      mother. She was most joyful at his return, and kissed him more than fifty
      times, and ceased not to praise God for having restored her grandson in
      good health.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the feasting was over, bed-time came. There were in the cottage but
      two beds&mdash;the one for the father and mother, and the other for the
      grandmother. So it was arranged that the son should sleep with his
      grandmother, at which she was very glad, but he grumbled, and only
      complied to oblige his parents, and as a makeshift for one night.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was in bed with his grandmother, it happened, I know not how, that
      he began to get on the top of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What are you doing?" she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never you mind," he replied, "and hold your tongue." When she saw that he
      really meant to ravish her, she began to cry out as loud as she could for
      her son, who slept in the next room, and then jumped out of bed and went
      and complained to him, weeping bitterly meanwhile.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the other heard his mother's complaint, and the unfilial conduct of
      his son, he sprang out of bed in great wrath, and swore that he would kill
      the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The son heard this threat, so he rose quickly, slipped out of the house,
      and made his escape. His father followed him, but not being so light of
      foot, found the pursuit hopeless, so returned home, where his mother was
      still grieving over the offence her grandson had committed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind, mother!" he said. "I will avenge you."
    </p>
    <p>
      I know not how many days after that, the father saw his son playing tennis
      in the town of Laon, and drawing his dagger, went towards him, and would
      have stabbed him, but the young man slipped away and his father was seized
      and disarmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many there who knew that the two were father and son; so one
      said to the son,
    </p>
    <p>
      "How does this come about? What have you done to your father that he
      should seek to kill you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith! nothing," he replied. "He is quite in the wrong. He wants to do me
      all the harm in the world, because, just for once, I would ride his mother&mdash;whereas
      he has mounted mine more than five hundred times, and I never said a word
      about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      All those who heard this reply began to haugh heartily, and swore that he
      must be a good fellow. So they did their best to make peace for him with
      his father, and at last they succeeded, and all was forgiven and forgotten
      on both sides.

    <h2>
      STORY THE FIFTY-FIRST &mdash; THE REAL FATHERS.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By The Editor.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a woman who on her death-bed, in the absence of her husband, made
        over her children to those to whom they belonged, and how one of the
        youngest of the children informed his father.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      There formerly lived in Paris, a woman who was married to a good and
      simple man&mdash;he was one of our friends and it would have been
      impossible to have had a better. This woman was very beautiful and
      complaisant, and, when she was young, she never refused her favours to
      those who pleased her, so that she had as many children by her lovers as
      by her husband&mdash;about twelve or thirteen in all.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last she was very ill, and about to die, she thought she would
      confess her sins and ease her conscience. She had all her children brought
      to her, and it almost broke her heart to think of leaving them. She
      thought it would not be right to leave her husband the charge of so many
      children, of some of which he was not the father, though he believed he
      was, and thought her as good a woman as any in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      By means of a woman who was nursing her, she sent for two men who in past
      times had been favoured lovers. They came to her at once, whilst her
      husband was gone away to fetch a doctor and an apothecary, as she had
      begged him to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw these two men, she made all her children come to her, and
      then said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "You, such an one, you know what passed between us two in former days. I
      now repent of it bitterly, and if Our Lord does not show me the mercy I
      ask of Him, it will cost me dear in the next world. I have committed
      faults, I know, but to add another to them would be to make matters worse.
      Here are such and such of my children;&mdash;they are yours, and my
      husband believes that they are his. You cannot have the conscience to make
      him keep them, so I beg that after my death, which will be very soon, that
      you will take them, and bring them up as a father should, for they are, in
      fact, your own."
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke in the same manner to the other man, showing him the other
      children:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such and such are, I assure you, yours. I leave them to your care,
      requesting you to perform your duty towards them. If you will promise me
      to care for them, I shall die in peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      As she was thus distributing her children, her husband returned home, and
      was met by one of his little sons, who was only about four years old. The
      child ran downstairs to him in such haste that he nearly lost his breath,
      and when he came to his father, he said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, father! come quickly, in God's name!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has happened?" asked his father. "Is your mother dead?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said the child, "but make haste upstairs, or you will have no
      children left. Two men have come to see mother, and she is giving them
      most of my brothers and sisters. If you do not make haste, she will give
      them all away."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man could not understand what his son meant, so he hastened
      upstairs, and found his wife very ill, and with her the nurse, two of his
      neighbours, and his children.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked the meaning of the tale his son had told him about giving away
      his children.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will know later on," she said; so he did not trouble himself further,
      for he never doubted her in the least.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbours went away, commending the dying woman to God, and promising
      to do all she had requested, for which she thanked them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hour of her death drew near, she begged her husband to pardon
      her, and told him of the misdeeds she had committed during the years she
      had lived with him, and how such and such of the children belonged to a
      certain man, and such to another&mdash;that is to say those
      before-mentioned&mdash;and that after her death they would take charge of
      their own children.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was much astonished to hear this news, nevertheless he pardoned her for
      all her misdeeds, and then she died, and he sent the children to the
      persons she had mentioned, who kept them.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus he was rid of his wife and his children, and felt much less
      regret for the loss of his wife than he did for the loss of the children.

      STORY THE FIFTY-SECOND &mdash; THE THREE REMINDERS. <a
      href="#linklinknote-52" name="linklinknoteref-52" id="linklinknoteref-52">52</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De La Roche.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of three counsels that a father when on his deathbed gave his son,
        but to which the son paid no heed. And how he renounced a young girl he
        had married, because he saw her lying with the family chaplain the first
        night after their wedding.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there was a nobleman who was wise, prudent, and virtuous.
      When he was on his deathbed, he settled his affairs, eased his conscience
      as best he could, and then called his only son to whom he left his worldly
      wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      After asking his son to be sure and pray for the repose of his soul and
      that of his mother, to help them out of purgatory, he gave him three
      farewell counsels, saying; "My dear son, I advise you first of all never
      to stay in the house of a friend who gives you black bread to eat.
      Secondly, never gallop your horse in a valley. Thirdly, never choose a
      wife of a foreign nation. Always bear these three things in mind, and I
      have no doubt you will be fortunate,&mdash;but, if you act to the
      contrary, be sure you would have done better to follow your father's
      advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good son thanked his father for his wise counsels, and promised that
      he would heed them, and never act contrary to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      His father died soon after, and was buried with all befitting pomp and
      ceremony; for his son wished to do his duty to one to whom he owed
      everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after this, the young nobleman, who was now an orphan and did
      not understand household affairs, made the acquaintance of a neighbour,
      whom he constantly visited, drinking and eating at his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      This friend, who was married and had a beautiful wife, became very
      jealous, and suspected that our young nobleman came on purpose to see his
      wife, and that he was in reality her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      This made him very uncomfortable but he could think of no means of getting
      rid of his guest, for it would have been useless to have told him what he
      thought, so he determined that little by little he would behave in such a
      way that, if the young man were not too stupid, he would see that his
      frequent visits were far from welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      To put this project into execution, he caused black bread to be served at
      meals, instead of white. After a few of these repasts, the young nobleman
      remembered his father's advice. He knew that he done wrong, and secretly
      hid a piece of the black bread in his sleeve, and took it home with him,
      and to remind himself, he hung it by a piece of string from a nail in the
      wall of his best chamber, and did not visit his neighbour's house as
      formerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day after that, he, being fond of amusement, was in the fields, and
      his dogs put up a hare. He spurred his horse after them, and came up with
      them in a valley, when his horse, which was galloping fast, slipped, and
      broke its neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very thankful to find that his life was safe, and that he had
      escaped without injury. He had the hare for his reward, and as he held it
      up, and then looked at the horse of which he had been so fond, he
      remembered the second piece of advice his father had given him, and which,
      if he had kept in mind, he would have been spared the loss of his horse,
      and also the risk of losing his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrived home, he had the horse's skin hung by a cord next to the
      black bread; to remind him of the second counsel his father had given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time after this, he took it in his head to travel and see foreign
      countries, and having arranged all his affairs, he set out on his journey,
      and after seeing many strange lands, he at last took up his abode in the
      house of a great lord, where he became such a favourite that the lord was
      pleased to give him his daughter in marriage, on account of his pleasant
      manners and virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, he was betrothed to the girl, and the wedding-day came. But when
      he supposed that he was to pass the night with her, he was told that it
      was not the custom of the country to sleep the first night with one's
      wife, and that he must have patience until the next night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since it is the custom of the country," he said, "I do not wish it broken
      for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      After the dancing was over, his bride was conducted to one room, and he to
      another. He saw that there was only a thin partition of plaster between
      the two rooms. He made a hole with his sword in the partition, and saw his
      bride jump into bed; he saw also the chaplain of the household jump in
      after her, to keep her company in case she was afraid, or else to try the
      merchandise, or take tithes as monks do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our young nobleman, when he saw these goings on, reflected that he still
      had some tow left on his distaff, and then there flashed across his mind
      the recollection of the counsel his good father had given him, and which
      he had so badly kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      He comforted himself with the thought that the affair had not gone so far
      that he could not get out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, the good chaplain, who had been his substitute for the
      night, rose early in the morning, but unfortunately left his breeches
      under the bride's bed. The young nobleman, not pretending to know
      anything, came to her bedside, and politely saluted her, as he well knew
      how, and found means to surreptitiously take away the priest's breeches
      without anyone seeing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were great rejoicings all that day, and when evening came, the
      bride's bed was prepared and decorated in a most marvellous manner, and
      she went to bed. The bridegroom was told that that night he could sleep
      with his wife. He was ready with a reply, and said to the father and
      mother, and other relations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know not who I am, and yet you have given me your daughter, and
      bestowed on me the greatest honour ever done to a foreign gentleman, and
      for which I cannot sufficiently thank you. Nevertheless, I have determined
      never to lie with my wife until I have shown her, and you too, who I am,
      what I possess, and how I am housed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl's father immediately replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are well aware that you are a nobleman, and in a high position, and
      that God has not given you so many good qualities without friends and
      riches to accompany them. We are satisfied, therefore do not leave your
      marriage unconsummated; we shall have time to see your state and condition
      whenever you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      To shorten the story, he vowed and swore that he would never sleep with
      her if it were not in his own house, and he conducted thither the bride's
      father and mother, and many of her relations and friends. He put his house
      in order to receive them, and to do so arrived there a day before them.
      And as soon as he alighted, he took the priest's breeches, and hung them
      in the chamber, by the black bread and the horse's skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most cordially received were the relations and friends of the fair bride,
      and they were much astonished to see the house of the young gentleman so
      well furnished with vessels, carpets, and all other kinds of furniture,
      and they thought themselves lucky to have procured such a husband for the
      girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were looking round, they came to the great chamber, which was all
      hung round with fair tapestry, and they perceived the brown bread, the
      horse's skin, and a pair of breeches hanging there; at which they were
      much astonished, and asked their host the meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied that he would willingly, and for a very good reason, tell them
      the meaning,&mdash;but after they had eaten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dinner was prepared, and God knows that it was well served, They had no
      sooner dined, than they demanded the interpretation of the mystery of the
      black bread, the horse's skin etc., and the worthy young gentleman related
      the story at length, and told how his father,&mdash;being on his death-bed
      as has been already narrated,&mdash;gave him three counsels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first was never to remain in a house where they gave me black bread.
      I paid no heed to this advice, for, after his death, I frequented the
      house of a neighbour, who became jealous of his wife, and in place of the
      white bread with which I was always served, gave me black; so in
      recollection and acknowledgment of the truth of that advice, I hung that
      piece of black bread there. The second counsel that my father gave me, was
      never to gallop my horse in a valley. I did not bear that in mind, and
      suffered for it, for one day, when riding in a valley after a hare pursued
      by my dogs, my horse fell and broke its neck, and it is a wonder I was not
      badly hurt. To remind me of my escape from death, the skin of the horse I
      then lost is hung there. The third counsel and advice that my father&mdash;whose
      soul is with God&mdash;gave me, was never to marry a woman of a strange
      nation. In this also I failed, and I will tell you what happened to me.
      The first night after I was married to your daughter, and you refused to
      let me sleep with her, I was lodged in a chamber close to hers, and as the
      partition between her and me was but thin, I pierced a hole with my sword,
      and I saw the chaplain of your household come and lie with her; but he
      left his breeches under the bed when he rose in the morning&mdash;which
      breeches I obtained possession of, and have hung them there as evidence of
      the everlasting truth of the third counsel that my late father gave me,
      and which I had not duly remembered and borne in mind; but in order that I
      may not again fall into the same errors, have placed here these three
      objects to render me prudent. And because&mdash;thank God&mdash;I am not
      so much committed to your daughter that she cannot now leave me, I would
      ask of you to take her back, and return to your own country, for as long
      as I live I will never come near her. But, because I have made you come a
      long way to show you that I am not the sort of man to take a priest's
      leavings, I am prepared to pay your expenses."
    </p>
    <p>
      The others did not know what to say, but seeing that their misdeeds were
      discovered, and seeing also that being far from their own country, force
      would not be on their side, were content to take the money for their
      expenses, and return whence they came; for if they had staked more they
      would have lost more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, as you have heard, were the three counsels which the good father
      gave his son, and which should not be forgotten; let everyone remember
      them, so far as they concern himself.

    <h2>
      STORY THE FIFTY-THIRD &mdash; THE MUDDLED MARRIAGES.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By The Archivist Of Brussels.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of two men and two women who were waiting to be married at the first
        Mass in the early morning; and because the priest could not see well, he
        took the one for the other, and gave to each man the wrong wife, as you
        will hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      One morning there were assembled in the cathedral of Sainte Gudule at
      Brussels, many men and women who wished to be married at the first Mass,
      which is said between four and five o'clock; and amongst others who wished
      to enter this sweet and happy condition, and promise before the priest to
      live honestly and uprightly, were a young man and a young woman who were
      not rich, who were standing near each other, waiting for the priest to
      call them to marry them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near them were an old man and an old woman, who had great possessions and
      wealth, but who, out of covetousness and the desire to have more, had also
      promised troth to one another, and were also waiting to be married at this
      first Mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest came and recited this much-desired Mass, and at the end
      thereof, as is the custom, had ranged before him those who wished to be
      married, of whom there were many, without counting the four I have
      mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that the good priest who was standing ready before the
      altar to accomplish the wedding rites, was blind of one eye, having lost
      an eye by some mischance a little time before. Also there was hardly any
      light in the chapel or on the altar, and, as it was winter, it was very
      dark. So he could not see the couples properly, and when he came to marry
      them, he took the rich old man and the poor, young girl, and joined them
      together with the wedding ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, he also took the poor, young man and married him to the
      rich, old woman,&mdash;without any of those in the church noticing it,
      either men or women&mdash;which was very strange, especially on the part
      of the men, for they dare to raise their heads and their eyes when they
      are on their knees before the priest, whilst the women who are modest and
      shy, always look down on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the custom on leaving the church for the friends of the bride to
      meet her, and conduct her to her husband's house. So it was that the poor,
      young girl was taken to the house of the rich man, and also the rich, old
      woman was escorted to the cottage of the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the young bride found herself in the court, and then in the great
      hall of the house of the man she had married by mistake, she was much
      astonished, and knew well that was not the house she had left that
      morning. When she was in the dressing-room, which was hung round with rich
      tapestries, she saw a large fire, a table well covered, on which a good
      breakfast was all ready, and a handsome sideboard, well garnished with
      vessels of all sorts, and was more astonished than ever, and thought it
      strange she did not know a soul present to whom she could speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was soon relieved of the cloak in which she was huddled-up, and when
      the bridegroom and the others who were there saw her uncovered, you may
      guess they were as much surprised as though horns had cropped up on their
      heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" said the bridegroom. "Is that my wife? By Our Lady, I am very
      lucky. She is much changed since yesterday; I think she must have been to
      the fountain of youth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do not know," replied those who had brought her, "whence she comes, or
      what she has done; but we are certain that is the woman you have married,
      for we took her at the altar, and since then she has never left our
      hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all much astonished, and remained long without saying a word,
      but the most foolish-looking and surprised of all was the poor bride; she
      was quite downcast and wept gently, for she would have much preferred to
      be with her lover, whom she had expected to marry that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridegroom, seeing her so miserable, had pity on her, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, do not be downcast; you are in a good house, please God, and no
      one is going to do you any harm. But tell me, if you please, who you are,
      and what information you can as to how you came here."
    </p>
    <p>
      When she heard herself spoken to so courteously, she regained a little
      courage, and gave the names of her father and mother, and said that she
      was of Brussels, and was betrothed to a certain young man, whom she named,
      and whom she had expected to have married.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridegroom, and all those who were there, began to laugh, and said
      that the priest had played them this trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, God be praised for the change!" said the bridegroom at last. "I do
      not greatly regret that God sent you to me, and I promise you on my word
      to make you a good husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," she said, weeping. "You are not my husband. I wish to go back to
      him to whom my father gave me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That shall not be," said he. "I married you in the holy church, and you
      cannot deny it. You are, and you will remain, my wife; and be content, for
      you are very lucky. I have, thank God, riches enough, of which you shall
      be the lady and mistress, and you will be very comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      He, and the others who were there, talked her over till at last she
      consented. So they had a light breakfast together, and then went to bed,
      and the old man did the best he knew how.
    </p>
    <p>
      But let us return to the old woman, and the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she found herself in the house, she was in a great rage, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What am I doing here? Why do you not take me either to my own house, or
      to the house of my husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridegroom, when he saw the old woman, and heard her speak, was much
      surprised, and so were his father and mother, and all who were there
      assembled. Then came out the father and mother, who knew the old woman,
      and the father spoke to his son, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My son, they have given you the wife of some one else, and it is to be
      supposed he has your wife. It is all the fault of our curé, who sees so
      badly, and&mdash;God help me&mdash;I was so far away from you when you
      were married that I never perceived the change."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What must I do?" asked the bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon my word," said his father, "I do not well know, but I greatly doubt
      if you can have any other wife than this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "St. John!" said the old woman, "I will not have him. I do not care for
      such a sorry fellow! I should be very happy, should I not? with a young
      fellow who did not care for me and would spend all my money, and if, I
      ventured to say a word would give me a crack on the head. Go away! go
      away! and fetch your wife, and let me go where I ought to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Our Lady!" said the bridegroom, "if I can get her back, I would rather
      have her than you, however poor she may be; but if I cannot obtain her,
      you will not go."
    </p>
    <p>
      His father, and some of his relations, went to the house where the old
      woman wished to be, and found the company breakfasting well, and preparing
      the caudle for the bride and bridegroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father stated the case, but the others replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      "You come too late; each must keep what he has; the master of the house is
      content with the wife that God has given him; he wedded her, and he does
      not want any other. And do not complain, for you would never have been so
      fortunate as to get your daughter married so well; now you will all be
      rich."
    </p>
    <p>
      The father returned home, and reported the answer he had, at which the old
      woman was in a great rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" she said, "am I to be deceived in this manner? By God, the
      matter shall not rest here; justice shall be done me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      If the old woman was displeased, as much, or more, was the young man, who
      was deprived of his ladylove. Still, he might have looked over that if he
      could have had the old woman, and all her money, but it was no good, she
      made herself so disagreeable that he was obliged to let her return home.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he was advised to summon her before the Bishop of Cambrai; and she also
      summoned the old man who had married the young woman, and a great lawsuit
      began, judgment in which is not given yet, so I can tell you no more about
      it.

    <h2>
      STORY THE FIFTY FOURTH &mdash; THE RIGHT MOMENT.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Mahiot D'auquesnes.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a damsel of Maubeuge who gave herself up to a waggoner, and
        refused many noble lovers; and of the reply that she made to a noble
        knight because he reproached her for this&mdash;as you will hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A noble knight of Flanders&mdash;young, lusty, and a good jouster, dancer,
      and singer, was once living in the county of Hainault with another noble
      knight of the same rank then living there, though he had a fine residence
      in Flanders. Love&mdash;as often happens&mdash;was the cause that he
      remained there, for he was much smitten by a damsel of Maubeuge, and God
      knows what he did for her; often giving jousts, masquerades, banquets, and
      whatever else was possible, and that he thought would please his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to some extent in her good graces for a time, but not so much as he
      wished to be. His friend, the knight of Hainault, who knew of his love
      affair, did all he could to assist him, and it was not his fault that his
      friend did not succeed better. But why make a long story? The good knight
      of Flanders, do all he would, and his friend also, could never obtain from
      the lady the supreme favour, but found her still harsh and unkind.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he was compelled to return to Flanders; so he took leave of his
      mistress, and left his friend there, and promised that if he did not
      return shortly he would often write to her, and give news about himself;
      and she promised the same on her side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it came to pass that a few days after the knight had returned to
      Flanders, that the lady wished to go on a pilgrimage, and made her
      arrangements accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the carriage was in front of her house, and the waggoner, who was
      a lusty fellow, strong and active, in it, preparing it for her, that she
      threw a cushion on his head, which caused him to fall on his hands and
      knees, at which she laughed loud and long.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, mademoiselle, you made me fall, but I will have my revenge, and
      before night I will make you tumble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would not be so unkind," she replied, and so saying she took another
      cushion, and when the waggoner was off his guard, she knocked him down
      again, and then laughed more heartily than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this, mademoiselle?" cried the waggoner. "Do you want to hurt me?
      I swear that if I were near you I would take my revenge at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What would you do?" said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I were up there I would show you," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would do miracles&mdash;to hear you talk; but you would never dare to
      come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No?" said he. "You shall see."
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumped out of the vehicle, entered the house, and ran upstairs, where
      he found the damsel in her petticoat, and as happy as she could be. He at
      once began to assail her, and&mdash;to cut matters short&mdash;she was not
      sorry to let him take what she could not in honour have given him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the appointed time she brought forth a fine little waggoner.
      The matter was not so secret but what the knight of Hainault heard of it,
      and was much surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote in haste, and sent the letter by a messenger to his friend in
      Flanders, to say that his mistress had had a child with the help of a
      waggoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may guess that the other was much surprised at the news, and he
      quickly came to Hainault to his friend, and begged of him to come and see
      his mistress and upbraid her with her misdeeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although she was keeping herself concealed at the time, the two knights
      found means to come to her. She was much ashamed and vexed to see them, as
      she well knew she would hear nothing pleasant from them, but she plucked
      up her courage, and put on the best countenance she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      They began by talking of various matters; and then the good knight of
      Flanders began his tirade, and called her all the names he could think of.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are," he said, "the most shameful and depraved woman in the world,
      and you have shown the wickedness of your heart by abandoning yourself to
      a low villain of a waggoner; although many noble persons offered you their
      services and you refused them all. For my own part, you know what I did to
      gain your love, and was I not more deserving of reward than a rascally
      waggoner who never did anything for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I beg of you, monsieur," she replied, "to say no more about it&mdash;what
      is done cannot be undone&mdash;but I tell you plainly that if you had come
      at the moment when the waggoner did, that I would have done for you what I
      did for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so?" he said. "By St. John! he came at a lucky moment! Devil take
      it! why was I not so fortunate as to know the right time to come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly," she said, "he came just at the moment when he ought to have
      come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, go to the devil!" he cried, "your moments, and you, and your waggoner
      as well."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with that he left, and his friend followed him, and they never had
      anything more to do with her,&mdash;and for a very good reason.

    <h2>
      STORY THE FIFTY-FIFTH &mdash; A CURE FOR THE PLAGUE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Villiers.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a girl who was ill of the plague and caused the death of three men
        who lay with her, and how the fourth was saved, and she also.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the year of the pardons of Rome (*) just past, the plague was so great
      and terrible in Dauphiné, that the greater part of the better-class people
      left the country.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) The great Jubilee of 1450.
</pre>
    <p>
      At that time a fair, young damsel felt herself stricken with the malady,
      and at once repaired to a neighbour, a woman of good condition, and rather
      old, and related her piteous condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbour, who was a wise and prudent woman, was not frightened at
      what the told her, and had even sufficient courage and assurance to
      comfort her with words, and what little she could do in the way of
      medicine. "Alas!" said the young girl who was sick, "my good neighbour, I
      greatly grieve that I must now leave the world and all the happinesses and
      amusements I have long enjoyed! But, by my oath! and between ourselves, my
      greatest sorrow is that I must die before I have known and tasted the good
      things of this world; such and such young men have often solicited me, and
      I bluntly refused them, for which I am now sorry; and if I die I shall
      never have another chance to let a man show me how to lose my maidenhead.
      They have told me that it is so pleasant and good, that I sorrow for my
      fair and tender body, which must rot without having had this much desired
      pleasure. And, to tell the truth, my good neighbour, it seems to me that
      if I once tasted this delight before my death, my end would be easier&mdash;I
      should die more easily, and with less regret. And, what is more, my heart
      is so set upon this that it might be medicine to me, and the cause of my
      cure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would to God!" said the old woman, "that nothing else were needed; you
      would be soon cured it seems to me, for&mdash;thank God&mdash;our town is
      not yet so destitute of of men that we cannot find a good fellow to do
      this job for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My good neighbour," said the young girl, "I would beg of you to go to
      such an one"&mdash;whom she named, who was a fine gentleman, and who had
      formerly been in love with her&mdash;"and tell him to come here and speak
      to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman set out, and found the gentleman, whom she sent to the
      house. As soon as he came there, the young girl, who, on account of her
      disease had a high colour, threw her arms round his neck, and kissed him
      twenty times. The young man, more joyful than ever to find her whom he had
      so much loved abandon herself to him, seized her without more ado, and
      showed her that which she so much desired to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not ashamed to beg and pray him to continue as he had commenced;
      and, in short, she made him begin again so often that he could do no more.
      When she saw that, as she had not yet had her fill, she was bold enough to
      say;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend you have often beseeched for that which I ask you now. You have
      done all that in you is, I know well. Nevertheless, I know that I have not
      all I want, and I am sure that I cannot live unless some one else comes
      and does to me what you have done, and therefore I beg of you, if you
      value my life, to go to such an one and bring him hither."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is true, my dear, that I know well he will do what you want."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman was much astonished at the request; nevertheless, though he
      had worked till he could do no more, he went off and found his companion,
      and brought him to her, and he soon set to work as the other had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was played out as his friend had been, she was not ashamed to ask
      him, as she had done the first, to bring to her another gentleman, and he
      did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      This made three with whom she had fought a love battle and defeated them
      all; but you must know that the first gentleman felt ill, and stricken
      with the plague, as soon as he had sent his friend to take his place; so
      he hastened to the priest, and confessed as best he could, and then died
      in the priest's arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend also, the second comer, as soon as he had given up his place to
      the third, felt very ill, and asked everywhere after the one who was
      already dead. He met the priest, weeping and exhibiting great grief, who
      told him of the death of his friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, monsieur le curé, I am stricken as he was; hear my confession."
    </p>
    <p>
      The curé, in a great fright, made haste to hear his confession, and, when
      that was finished, the gentleman, though within two hours of his end, went
      to her from whom he and his friend had taken the contagion, and found with
      her the man he had fetched, and said to her;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cursed woman! you have killed me and my friend also. You ought to be
      burned to death! Nevertheless I pardon you, and may God pardon you! You
      have the plague, and have given it to my friend, who died in the priest's
      arms, and I shall soon follow him." With that he left, and died an hour
      later in his own house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third gentleman, who had run the same risks as his companions, who
      were both dead, did not feel very safe. Nevertheless, he took courage, and
      cast aside all fear, and bethought him that he had often been in perils
      and dangerous battles before, and went to the father and mother of the
      girl who had killed his two companions, and told them that their daughter
      was ill, and that they must take care of her. That being done, he so
      conducted himself that he escaped the danger of which his two friends had
      died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that when this slayer of men was brought back to her
      father's house, whilst they were making a bed ready in which she could
      repose and sweat, she sent secretly for the son of a shoe-maker, a
      neighbour, and had him brought to her father's stable, where she made him
      work as she had done the others, but he did not live four hours after.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was put to bed, and they made her sweat greatly. And soon there
      appeared upon her body four buboes, of which she was afterwards cured. And
      I believe that you will find her now amongst the prostitutes at Avignon,
      Vienne, Valence, or some other place in Dauphiné.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the doctors said that she had escaped death because she had tasted the
      joys of this life; which is a notable and true example to many young girls
      to never refuse a good thing when it comes in their way.

      STORY THE FIFTY-SIXTH &mdash; THE WOMAN, THE PRIEST, THE SERVANT, AND THE
    </h2>
    <p>
      WOLF.
    </p>
    <p>
      By Monseigneur De Villiers.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a gentleman who caught, in a trap that he laid, his wife, the
        priest, her maid, and a wolf; and burned them all alive, because his
        wife committed adultery with the priest.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In a town in this kingdom, in the duchy of Auvergne, there formerly lived
      a gentleman, who, to his misfortune, had a very pretty young wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      This damsel was acquainted with a priest, a neighbour, who lived half a
      league off, and they were so neighbourly together that the good priest
      took the gentleman's place whenever he was absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this damsel had a waiting-maid who was acquainted with all their
      doings, and often carried messages to the priest, and advised him of the
      place and hour when he could safely come to her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The matter was not so well hid as the lovers would have liked, for a
      gentleman, who was a near relative of him to whom this dishonour was done,
      was informed of the affair, and told the person most concerned all that he
      knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may fancy that the good gentleman, when he heard that in his absence
      his wife was helped by the priest, was not overpleaaed, and if it had not
      been for his cousin would have taken terrible vengeance as soon as he
      heard the news; but consented to put it off until he had taken them both
      in the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and his cousin arranged to go on a pilgrimage, four or six leagues from
      home, and take his wife and the priest, in order to take note how they
      behaved towards each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were returning from this pilgrimage, during which the curé had
      made love as he best could,&mdash;that is to say by glances and other
      little devices&mdash;the husband caused himself to be sent for by a
      messenger he had instructed, to come at once to a lord of that country.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pretended to be very vexed, and to leave with much regret, &mdash;nevertheless,
      since the lord had sent for him he could not disobey. So he went his way,
      and his cousin, the other gentleman, said that he would keep him company,
      as that was his way to return home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest and the lady much rejoiced to hear this news; they consulted
      together and decided that the priest should take leave and quit the house,
      in order that none of the people there might suspect him, and about
      midnight he would return to the lady, as he was accustomed. No sooner was
      this determined on than the priest said farewell, and left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that the husband and his relative were hidden in a gorge
      through which the priest would have to pass, and could neither go or
      return any other way, without going out of the right road.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw the priest pass, and judged that he would return that night&mdash;as
      indeed was his intention. They let him pass without saying a word, and
      then prepared a large pitfall, with the help of some peasants who aided
      them in the task. The trap was quickly and well made, and it was not long
      before a wolf, passing that way, fell into the pit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after came the priest, clad in a short gown, and with a curtle axe
      hung round his neck; and when he came to where the pitfall had been dug,
      he fell into it on the wolf, at which he was much alarmed, and the wolf,
      who was down there first, was as much afraid of the priest as the priest
      was of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the two gentlemen saw the priest lodged along with the wolf, they
      were much delighted, and he who was most concerned, declared that the
      priest should never come out alive, for he would kill him there. The other
      blamed him for this, and did not wish the priest killed, and was of
      opinion they should rather cut off his genitals; but the husband wanted
      him killed, and this discussion lasted for a long time, while they were
      awaiting the dawn, when they could see clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst they were thus waiting, the lady, who expected the priest, and did
      not know why he tarried so long, sent her servant-maid in order to make
      him hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid, whilst on her road to the cure's house, fell into the trap with
      the wolf and the curé. She was much astonished to find herself in such
      company.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said the priest, "I am lost. We have been found out, and someone
      has laid this trap for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband and his cousin, who heard and saw all, were both as pleased as
      they could be; and they felt as sure as though the Holy Spirit had
      revealed it to them, that the mistress would fellow the maid, for they had
      heard the maid say that her mistress had sent her to the priest to know
      why he had failed to come at the hour agreed upon between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mistress, finding that neither the curé or the maid came, and that
      dawn was approaching, suspected that there was something, and that she
      should find them in a little wood there was on the road&mdash;which was
      where the trap was laid&mdash;and determined to go there and try and find
      out if there was any news.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked along towards the priest's house, and when she came to the spot
      where the trap was laid, she tumbled in along with the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they found themselves all assembled, it need not be said that they
      were much astonished, and each did his or her utmost to get out of the
      pit, but it was no good, and they looked upon themselves as being as good
      as dead, as well as dishonoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the two prime movers in the affair&mdash;that is to say the husband
      of the lady, and his cousin&mdash;came to the edge of the pit, and saluted
      the company, and told them to be comfortable, and asked them if they were
      ready for breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband, who was anxious for his revenge, managed to send his cousin
      to look after their horses, which were at a house near by, and when he had
      got rid of him, he made all the haste he could, and threw a quantity of
      brushwood into the pit, and set it on fire, and burned them all&mdash;wife,
      priest, waiting-woman and wolf.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that he left that part of the country, and went to the King to ask
      his pardon, which he easily obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      And some say that the King remarked that it was a pity the poor wolf
      should have been burned alive for the faults of the others.

    <h2>
      STORY THE FIFTY-SEVENTH &mdash; THE OBLIGING BROTHER.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monsieur De Villiers.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a damsel who married a shepherd, and how the marriage was
        arranged, and what a gentleman, the brother of the damsel, said.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      As you are all ready to listen to me, and no one comes forward at the
      present moment to continue this glorious and edifying book of a Hundred
      Stories, I will relate an instance which happened formerly in Dauphiné,
      fit to be included in the number of the said novels.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentleman who lived in Dauphiné, had in his house a sister, aged about
      eighteen or twenty, who was a companion to his wife, who loved her dearly,
      so that they agreed together like two sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that this gentleman was bidden to the house of a neighbour,
      who lived a couple of short leagues away, to visit him, and took with him
      his wife and sister. They went, and God knows how cordially they were
      received.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wife of the neighbour who invited them, took the wife and sister of
      the said gentleman for a walk after supper, talking of various matters,
      and they came to the hut of the shepherd, which was near a large and fine
      park in which the sheep were kept, and found there the chief shepherd
      looking after his flock. And&mdash;as women will&mdash;they enquired about
      many and various things, and amongst others they asked if he was not cold
      in his cottage? He replied he was not, and that he was more comfortable in
      his hut than they were in their glazed, matted, and well-floored chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked also of other matters, and some of their phrases had a bawdy
      meaning; and the worthy shepherd, who was neither a fool nor a blockhead,
      swore to them that he was prepared to undertake to do the job eight or
      nine times in one night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sister of our gentleman cast amorous glances at the shepherd when she
      heard this, and did not fail to tell him, when she found a fitting
      opportunity, that he had made an impression on her, and that he was to
      come to see her at her brother's house, and that she would make him
      welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shepherd, who saw she was a pretty girl, was not a little pleased at
      this news, and promised to come and see her. And, in short, he did as he
      had promised, and at the hour arranged between his lady-love and him was
      in front of her window; and though it was a high and dangerous ascent,
      nevertheless he accomplished it by means of a cord which she let down, and
      a vine there was there, and was soon in her chamber, where, it need not be
      said, he was heartily welcomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed that it was no empty boast he had made, for before daylight, the
      stag had eight horns, at which the lady was greatly pleased. And you must
      know that before the shepherd could come to the lady, he had to walk two
      leagues, and swim the broad river, Rhone, which was close to the house
      where his mistress lived; and when day came he had to recross the Rhone,
      and return to his sheepfold; and he continued to do this for a long time
      without being discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time many gentlemen of that country demanded the hand of this
      damsel turned shepherdess, in marriage, but not one of them was to her
      taste; at which her brother was not best pleased, and said so many times,
      but she was always well provided with answers and excuses. She informed
      her lover, the shepherd, of all this, and one night she promised him that,
      if he wished, she would never have any other husband but him. He replied
      that he desired nothing better;
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it can never be," he said; "on account of your brother and your other
      friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not trouble yourself about that," she said, "let me manage as I like
      and it will be all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they plighted troth to one another. But soon after that there came a
      gentleman to make a last request for the hand of the lady shepherdess, and
      who said he would marry her if she were only dressed in the manner
      becoming her station without any other portion. Her brother would have
      willingly listened to this demand, and tried to persuade his sister to
      give her consent, pointing out to her what her duty was in such a case;
      but he could not succeed, at which he was much displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw that he was angry with her, she took him on one side, and
      said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brother, you have long lectured me, and pressed me to marry such and such
      a man, and I would never consent. Now I beg of you not to be angry with or
      bear any resentment towards me, and I will tell you what has prevented my
      acceding to any of these requests, if you will promise not to be still
      more enraged against me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her brother willingly promised. When she had obtained this assurance, she
      told him that she was as good as married already, and that as long as she
      lived she would never have for husband any other man than the one she
      would show him that night if he wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should much like to see him," replied her brother, "but who is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will see in good time," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the accustomed hour the shepherd came, and climbed to the lady's
      chamber, God knows how wet from having crossed the river. The brother
      looked at him, and saw it was his neighbour's shepherd, and was in no
      small degree astonished; and still more so was the shepherd, who would
      have fled when he saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay! Stay!" said the gentleman, "there is nothing to fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is this," he added turning to his sister, "the man of whom you spoke to
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, truly, brother," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then make a good fire for him to warm himself," said the gentleman, "for
      he much needs it. And do you regard him as your husband; and truly you are
      not wrong to like him, for he has run great dangers for love of you. And
      since the matter has gone so far, and you have the courage to take him for
      a husband, never mind me, and cursed be he who does not hurry on the
      marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen!" she said. "It shall be to-morrow, if you wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do wish," he replied; then turning to the shepherd.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever you wish."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing else for it then," said the gentleman. "You are, and
      shall be, my brother-in-law. Not so long ago our family was not noble; so
      I may well have a shepherd for a brother-in-law."
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut the story short, the gentleman consented to the marriage of his
      sister to the shepherd; and it was performed, and they both continued to
      live in his house, though it was much talked about throughout the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he was in some place where the affair was being talked about, and
      surprise was expressed that he had not killed or beaten the shepherd, the
      gentleman replied that he would never harm one whom his sister loved; and
      that he would rather have for a brother-in-law, a shepherd his sister
      liked, than some great man she did not like.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was said as a joke, and sportingly; for he was, and has always
      been, a courteous and pleasant gentleman, and liked not to hear his
      sister's name bandied about, even amongst his friends and boon companions.

    <h2>
      STORY THE FIFTY-EIGHTH &mdash; SCORN FOR SCORN.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of two comrades who wished to make their mistresses better inclined
        towards them, and so indulged in debauchery, and said, that as after
        that their mistresses still scorned them, that they too must have played
        at the same game&mdash;as you will hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I knew, in the time of my green and virtuous youth, two gentlemen, good
      comrades, accomplished, and provided with every quality to be praised in a
      virtuous gentleman. They were friends, and were alike each other in every
      respect, not only bodily, but as regarded their clothes, their servants,
      and their horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that they fell in love with two fair young damsels of good
      family and gracious, and they did for these fair ladies' sake a hundred
      thousand little courtesies. Their vows were listened to&mdash;but nothing
      more. Perhaps the damsels had lovers already, or did not wish to have a
      love affair on their hands, for in truth the youths were both good
      fellows, such as many a noble lady would have liked for a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Be that as it may, they could not win their ladies' love, which caused
      them to pass many nights in God knows what sorrow, now cursing fortune,
      now love, and most often their mistresses for being so unkind. Whilst they
      were suffering this rage and grief, one of them said one day to his
      friend,
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can see with half an eye that our mistresses do not care for us, and
      yet we more madly desire them than ever, and the more scorn and harshness
      they show us the more we desire to please, serve, and obey them! Upon my
      word this seems to me the height of folly. Let us, I pray you, think no
      more of them than they do of us, and you will see that when they know
      that, it will be their turn to seek and importune us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said the other, "very good advice, no doubt, but how can it be
      carried out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have found the means," said the first. "I have always heard it said,
      and Ovid puts it in his book, The Remedy of Love, that to do&mdash;you
      know what&mdash;much and often, makes you forget or think little of the
      person with whom you are in love. I will tell you what we will do. We will
      take home with us a couple of nice young 'cousins' (*), and we will sleep
      with them, and commit every folly with them that our strength will permit,
      and then we will go and see our ladies, and the devil is in it if they do
      not then care for us."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) Prostitutes.   The word is doubtless derived from
     <i>coussin</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      The other agreed, and the proposal was carried out, and each took home a
      nice wench. And after that they went to a great feast where their ladies
      were, and they flaunted in front of the damsels, chattering carelessly
      here and there, and seeming to say in a hundred thousand ways, "We do not
      care for you", believing that, as they had devised, their mistresses would
      be displeased, and would try to make their lovers return to their
      allegiance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it happened quite otherwise, for if the youths appeared to think but
      little of the ladies, they on the other hand, showed openly that they
      cared nothing for the young men, which the latter perceived, and were much
      amazed at. The one said to his friend;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know what is the matter? Morbleu! our mistresses have done exactly
      what we have done. Do you not see how scornful they are? They carry
      themselves exactly as we do&mdash;and, believe me, for the very same
      reason. They have each chosen a paramour and indulged in folly to the
      utmost. Devil take the bitches! Let us leave them alone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath!" replied the other, "I believe it is as you say. I never
      expected to find them like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the two friends thought that their mistresses had done the same as they
      had done themselves, because the damsels took no more heed of them than
      they did of the damsels&mdash;which may not have been true, but was not
      difficult to believe.

      In the town of St. Omer there lived formerly a a good fellow, sergeant to
      the king, who was married to a good and chaste woman, who had, by a former
      marriage, a son grown up and married.
    </p>
    <p>
      This good fellow, notwithstanding that he had a virtuous and prudent wife,
      made love day and night with whomsoever he had a chance, and as often as
      possible. And as in winter it was often inconvenient to go far to seek for
      his love affairs, he bethought himself and reflected that he need not
      leave home for a mistress, for that his wife's maid was a very pretty,
      young, and well-mannered girl, and he might manage to become her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, by gifts and promises, he obtained the girl's permission to do
      whatever he wished, but there were difficulties in the way, for his wife,
      knowing her husband's character, always kept an eye upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Cupid, who always comes to the help of his true followers,
      inspired his good and loyal worshipper with an idea by which he could
      accomplish his ends; for he pretended to be very sick of a chill, and said
      to his wife;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear helpmate, come here! I am as ill as I can be; I must go to bed,
      and I beg of you to make all the servants go to bed too, in order that
      there may be no noise or disturbance, and then come to our chamber."
    </p>
    <p>
      The worthy woman, who was much vexed at her husband's illness, did as she
      was ordered, and took fair sheets and warmed them, and put them over her
      husband after he was in bed. And when he had been well warmed for a long
      time, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, that will suffice. I am well enough now, thanks be to God and to
      you for the trouble you have taken; and I beg of you to come and lie down
      by my side."
    </p>
    <p>
      She only desired her husband's health and repose, and did as she was
      desired, and went to sleep as quickly as possible. As soon as he perceived
      she was asleep, he slipped quietly out of bed, and went to the servant's
      bed, where he was well received, and broke so many lances that he was
      tired and worn out, and dropped off to sleep in her fair arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      It often happens that when we go to bed vexed or melancholy we are easily
      awakened,&mdash;indeed that may be the cause of our waking, and so it
      happened to the wife. And as she took great care of her husband, she put
      out her hand to touch him, and discovered that he was not in the bed; and
      on feeling the pillow and the place where he had been lying, she found
      that they were cold, and that he had been out of bed a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in despair, she jumped out of bed and put on a chemise and a
      petticoat, and said to herself;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Idle and worthless wretch that you are, you have much to reproach
      yourself with, for by your neglect you have let your husband die. Alas!
      why did I come to bed to-night and fall asleep; O Virgin Mary! I pray that
      nothing has happened to him through my fault, or I shall deem myself
      guilty of his death."
    </p>
    <p>
      After these regrets and lamentations, she went off to seek a light, and in
      order that the servant-maid might help her to find her lost husband, she
      went to her room to arouse her, and there found the happy pair, asleep
      locked in each other's arms, and it seemed that they must have worked well
      that night, for they were not awakened by her coming into the room or by
      the light she carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was glad that her husband was not as ill as she had feared or
      expected; and went to seek her children and all the servants of the
      household, and brought them to see the couple, and asked them in a low
      voice, who that was in the maid's bed, sleeping with her? And the children
      replied that it was their father, and the servants that it was their
      master. Then she led them out, and made them go to bed again, for it was
      too early to get up, and she also went back to bed, but did not sleep
      again till it was time to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after she had left the lovers, they woke up, and took leave of each
      other amorously. The master returned to bed, to his wife's side, without
      saying a word, nor did she, but pretended to be asleep, at which he was
      very glad, thinking that she knew nothing of his adventure, for he greatly
      feared her, both for his peace and that of the girl. So he slept soundly,
      and his wife, as soon as it was time to get up, rose, and to please her
      husband, and give him something comforting after the laxative medicine
      that he had taken that night, woke up her servants, and called her maid,
      and told her to kill the two fattest capons in the fowl-house, and prepare
      them nicely, and then go to the butcher and buy the best bit of beef she
      could procure, and put it in water to make a good soup, as she well knew
      how, for she was a capital cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, who heartily desired to please her mistress and her master, the
      one for love and the other from fear, said that she would willingly do all
      that was commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the wife went to Mass, and on her return passed by the house of her
      son, of whom I have spoken, and asked him to come and dine with her
      husband, and to bring with him three or four good fellows whom she named,
      and whom she and her husband wished invited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she returned home to see after the dinner, and found that her husband
      had gone to church. Meanwhile, her son had gone round to invite the guests
      his mother had named, and who were the greatest jokers in St. Omer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man came back from Mass, and embraced his wife, and she did the
      same to him, and, in order that he should not suspect anything, she said
      that she rejoiced at his recovery, for which he thanked her, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed I am in fairly good health, my dear, after last night, and I think
      I have a very good appetite, so we will have dinner at once if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied, "I am very glad to hear, it but you must wait a little till
      the dinner is ready; and until such and such people, whom I have invited
      to dine with you, have arrived."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Invited!" said he, "and for what reason? I do not care about them and
      would rather they stayed where they are; for they jest at everything, and
      if they know I have been ill, they will tease me about it. At least, my
      dear, let me beg of you to say nothing about it. And there is another
      thing&mdash;what will they eat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She said he need not trouble about that; they would have enough to eat,
      for she had dressed the two best capons, as well as a fine piece of beef,
      and all in his honour, at which he was very glad, and said it was well
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after came those who had been invited, and the woman's son. And when
      all was ready, they sat at the table and made good cheer, especially the
      host, and they drank often one to another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host said to his stepson;
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, my friend, drink with your mother, and enjoy yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he replied that he would willingly do so; and when he drank to his
      mother, the maid, who was waiting at table came into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the wife called her, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, my dear friend and companion! drink to me, and I will pledge
      thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friend and companion!" said the host. "What is the meaning of all this
      affection? What mischief is brewing now? This is something new!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, she is truly my honest and trusted companion! Why do you wonder
      at that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the devil, Joan! take care what you say! Any one would think there
      was something between her and me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why should they not?" she said. "Did I not find you last night lying
      in her bed, and sleeping in her arms?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In her bed?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, yes," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my honour, gentlemen, it is not true, and she only says so to spite
      me, and bring shame on the poor girl, for she never saw me there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil I did not!" she replied. "You shall hear the statement again
      from those of your own household."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that she called the children, and the servants who were standing
      there, and asked them if they had not seen their father lying with the
      maid, and they answered, yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie, you naughty boys," replied their father. "Your mother told you
      to say it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begging your pardon, father, we saw you there; and so did the servants."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so?" asked the lady of the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is quite true," they replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all who were present laughed loudly, and teased him terribly, for his
      wife related all about his pretended illness, and what he had done, and
      how she had prepared the dinner and invited his friends in order to make
      the story known, at which he was so ashamed that he hardly dared hold up
      his head, and did not know what to reply except to say,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on! you are all against me, so I will hold my tongue and let you have
      your own way, for I can't contend against the lot of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards he ordered the table to be removed, and when grace was said, he
      called his stepson and whispered to him;
    </p>
    <p>
      "John, my friend, although the others accuse me, I know that you believe
      me. See how much is owing to that poor girl, and pay her so liberally that
      she will have no cause to complain, and send her away; for I know well
      that your mother will never permit her to stay in the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stepson went and did as he was ordered, then he returned to the
      friends whom he had brought, whom he found talking to his mother, then
      they thanked her for their entertainment, and took leave and went.
    </p>
    <p>
      The husband and wife remained at home, and it is to be supposed that he
      did not hear the last of it for some time. For the poor husband did not
      drain his cup of bitterness at the dinner-table, but found that the
      proverb about dogs, hawks, war, and love, which says, "Every pleasure has
      a thousand sorrows," is true. But none should run the risk if they are not
      prepared to pay the penalty. Thus did it happen that the adventure of this
      worthy fellow ended in the manner related.

      STORY THE SIXTIETH &mdash; THREE VERY MINOR BROTHERS. <a
      href="#linklinknote-60" name="linklinknoteref-60" id="linklinknoteref-60">60</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Poncelet.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of three women of Malines, who were acquainted with three cordeliers,
        and had their heads shaved, and donned the gown that they might not be
        recognised, and how it was made known.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Formerly there were in the town of Malines three damsels, the wives of
      three burghers of the town,&mdash;rich, powerful, and of good position,
      who were in love with three Minor Friars; and to more secretly and
      covertly manage their amours under the cloak of religion, they rose every
      day an hour or two before dawn, and when it appeared a fit time to go and
      see their lovers, they told their husbands they were going to matins to
      the first Mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owing to the great pleasure that they took in these exercises and the
      monks also, it often happened that it was broad daylight, and they could
      not leave the convent without being perceived by the other monks.
      Therefore, fearing the great perils and inconveniences which might arise,
      they arranged between them that each should wear a monk's gown, and have a
      tonsure made on her head, as though they belonged to the convent. So
      finally one day that they were in the convent, and whilst their husbands
      suspected nothing of it, a barber,&mdash;that is to say a monk belonging
      to the convent&mdash;was sent for secretly to the cells of the three
      brothers, and he cut a tonsure on the head of each.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when the time came to leave, they put on the friars' gowns with which
      they were provided, and in that state returned to their respective homes,
      and undressed, and left their disguise with certain discreet matrons, and
      then returned to their husbands; and this continued for a long while,
      without any person being aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But since it would have been a great pity that such excessive devotion
      should not be known, fortune so willed that as on a certain day one of
      these ladies was on her road to the accustomed haunt, her trick was
      discovered, and she was caught in her disguise by her husband, who had
      followed her, and who said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good brother, I am glad to have met you! I would beg of you to return to
      my house, for I have many things to say to you," and with that he took her
      back, at which she hardly felt joyful.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they were in the house, the husband said, in a joking manner;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear helpmate, can you swear on your honour that it is true piety,
      which in the middle of winter, causes you to don the habit of St. Francis,
      and have your head shaved like the good monks? Tell me the name of your
      confessor, or by St. Francis you shall suffer for it,"&mdash;and he
      pretended to draw his dagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor woman threw herself on her knees, and cried;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have mercy upon me, husband! for I have been led astray by bad
      companions! I know that you could kill me if you liked, and that I have
      not behaved as I should, but I am not the only one the monks have led
      astray, and, if you promise that you will do nothing to me, I will tell
      you all."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this her husband agreed; and then she told him how she often went to
      the monastery with two of her cronies who were in love with two of the
      monks, and they often breakfasted together in the monks' cells. "A third
      monk was in love with me," she continued, "and made such humble and
      impassioned requests to me that I could not excuse myself, and by the
      instigation and example of my companions, I did as they did, they all
      saying that we should have a good time together, and no one would know
      about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the husband demanded the names of her female friends, and she told
      him. He was acquainted with their husbands, and they had often eaten and
      drunk together. Finally, he asked who was the barber, and the names of the
      three monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good husband, after considering all things, and moved by the piteous
      groans and sad regrets of his wife, said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care that you tell no one that you have spoken to me on this matter,
      and I promise you that I will do you no harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      She promised that she would do whatever he wished. With that he went away
      at once, and invited to dinner the two husbands and their wives, the three
      Cordeliers, and the barber, and they all promised to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day they all came, and sat at table, and enjoyed themselves
      without expecting any bad news. After the table was removed, they had many
      joyous jests and devices to discover who should pay scot for all, and as
      they could not agree, the host said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since we cannot agree as to who is to pay the reckoning, I will tell you
      what we will do. The one who has the baldest crown to his head shall pay&mdash;of
      course excluding these good monks, who pay nothing&mdash;at present."
    </p>
    <p>
      To which they all agreed, and were content that it should be thus, and
      that the barber should be the judge. And when all the men had shown their
      heads, the host said that they ought to look at their wives' heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      It need not be asked if there were not some there present who felt their
      hearts sink within them. Without an instant's delay, the host uncovered
      his wife's head, and when he saw the tonsure he pretended to admire it
      greatly, pretending that he knew nothing about it, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must see if the others are the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then their husbands made them remove their head-dresses, and they were
      found to be tonsured like the first one, at which the men were not best
      pleased, notwithstanding that they laughed loudly, and declared that the
      question had been settled, and that it was for their wives to pay the
      reckoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they wished to know how these tonsures came there, and the host,
      rejoicing to be able to divulge such a secret, related the whole affair,
      on condition that they would pardon their wives this time, after they had
      been witnesses of the penance the good monks were to undergo in their
      presence,&mdash;and to this both husbands agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the host caused four or five sturdy varlets to come out of a chamber
      near by, and they, knowing what they had to do, seized the worthy monks
      and gave them as many blows as they could find room for on their
      shoulders, and then turned them out of the house. The others remained for
      a certain space, and it is to be supposed that a good deal of conversation
      passed between them, but as it would take too long to recount, I pass it
      over here, for the sake of brevity.

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a merchant who locked up in a bin his wife's lover, and she
        secretly put an ass there which caused her husband to be covered with
        confusion.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It happened once that in a large town of Hainault there lived a good
      merchant married to a worthy woman. He travelled much, to buy and sell his
      merchandise, and this caused his wife to have a lover in his absence, and
      this continued for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, the secret was at last discovered by a neighbour, who was a
      relative of the husband, and lived opposite the merchant's house, and who
      often saw a gallant enter the merchant's house at night and leave in the
      morning. Which matter was brought to the knowledge of the person to whose
      prejudice it was, by this neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merchant was much vexed, nevertheless he thanked his relative and
      neighbour, and said that he would shortly see into the matter, and for
      that purpose would shut himself up one night in his neighbour's house,
      that he might see if anyone visited his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, he pretended to start on a journey, and told his wife and his
      servants that he did not know when he should return. He started in the
      early morning, but returned the same evening, and having left his horse at
      some house, came secretly to his cousin, and peeped through a little
      lattice, expecting to see that which would hardly have pleased him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited till about nine o'clock, when the gallant, whom the damsel had
      informed that her husband was away, passed once or twice before his
      lady-love's house, and looked at the door to see if he might enter, but
      found it closed. He guessed that it was not yet time, and whilst he
      strolled about waiting, the good merchant, who thought that this was the
      man he wanted, came down, and went to his door, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Friend, the lady heard you, and as she is afraid that the master may come
      back, she sent me down to let you in, if you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gallant, thinking it was the servant, followed him, the door was
      opened gently, and he was conducted into a chamber in which there was a
      large bin, which the merchant unlocked and made the young man enter, that
      he should not be discovered if the husband returned. "My mistress will
      come and talk to you and let you out," added the merchant as he turned the
      key in the lock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gallant suffered all this for the sake of what was to follow, and
      because he believed that the other spoke the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the merchant started off at once as quickly as he could, and went to
      the cousin and his wife, and said to them:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rat is caught; but now we must consider what to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cousin, and more particularly his wife&mdash;for there was no love
      lost between the two women&mdash;were very glad to hear this, and said
      that it would be best for him to show the gallant to all his wife's
      relations in order that they might know how she conducted herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being determined on, the merchant went to the house of his wife's
      father and mother, and told them that if ever they wished to see their
      daughter alive they must come at once to his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      They jumped up at once, and, whilst they were preparing, he also went off
      to two of her brothers and her sisters, and told them the same thing. Then
      he took them all to the cousin's house, and related the whole history, and
      how the rat had been caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know what the gallant did in the bin all the time, until he
      was luckily released. The damsel, who wondered greatly that her lover did
      not come, went backwards and forwards to the door, to see if he were
      coming. The young man, who heard her pass close to him without ever
      speaking to him, began to thump with his fist on the side of the bin. The
      damsel heard it, and was greatly frightened; nevertheless she asked who
      was there, and the gallant replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, my dearest love, I am dying here of heat and doubt, for I am much
      surprised that I have been shut in here, and that no one has yet come to
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Virgin Mary! who can have put you there, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath I know not," he replied; "but your varlet came to me and told
      me that you had asked him to bring me into the house, and that I was to
      get into this bin, that the husband might not find me if by chance he
      should come back to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said she, "by my life that must have been my husband. I am a lost
      woman; and our secret has been discovered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know what is to be done?" he said. "In the first place you must
      let me out, or I will break everything, for I can no longer endure being
      shut up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath!" said the damsel, "I have not the key; and if you break
      through, I am undone, for my husband will say that I did it to save you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, the damsel searched about, and found a lot of old keys, amongst
      which was one that delivered the poor captive. As soon as he was out, he
      tumbled the lady, to show her what a grudge he had against her, which she
      bore patiently. After that her lover would have left her, but the damsel
      hung round his neck, and told him that if he went away like that, she
      would be as much dishonoured as though he had broken out of the bin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is to be done then?" said the gallant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must put something there for my husband to find, or he will think that
      I have let you out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what shall we put there?" asked the lover. "For it is time for me to
      go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have in the stable," she said, "an ass, that we will put in if you
      will help me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, I will," he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ass was driven into the bin, and it was locked again, and then her
      lover took leave of her with a sweet kiss, and left by a back-door, whilst
      the damsel quickly got into bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst these things were happening, her husband had assembled all his
      wife's relatives, and brought them to his cousin's house, as has been
      said, where he informed them of what he had done, and how he had caught
      the gallant, and had him under lock and key.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And in order that you shall not say," he added, "that I blame your
      daughter without cause, you shall both see and touch the scoundrel who has
      done us this dishonour, and I beg that he may be killed before he can get
      away."
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one present declared that it should be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then," said the merchant, "I will send you back your daughter for
      such as she is."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that they all accompanied him, though sorrowing much at the news, and
      they took with them torches and flambeaux, so as to be better able to
      search, and that nothing should escape them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They knocked so loudly that the damsel came before anyone else in the
      house was awakened, and opened the door, and when they had come in, she
      abused her husband, her father, her mother, and the others, and declared
      that she wondered greatly what could have brought them all at that hour of
      the night. At these words her husband stepped forward, and gave her a good
      buffet, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall know soon enough, false such and such that you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! take care what you say. Was it for that you brought my father and
      mother here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the mother, "false wench that you are. We will drag forth your
      paramour directly."
    </p>
    <p>
      And her sisters said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, sister you did not learn at home to behave like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sisters," she replied, "by all the saints of Rome, I have done nothing
      that a good woman should not do. I should like to see anyone prove the
      contrary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie!" said her husband. "I can prove it at once, and the rascal shall
      be killed in your presence. Up quickly! and open me this bin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I?" she replied. "In truth I think you must be dreaming, or out of your
      senses, for you know well that I have never had the key, but that it hangs
      at your belt along with the others, ever since the time that you locked up
      your goods. If you want to open it, open it. But I pray to God that, as
      truly as I have never kept company with whoever is in that box, that He
      will deliver me, to my great joy, and that the evil spite that you have
      against me may be clearly proved and demonstrated&mdash;and I have full
      hope and confidence that it will be so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I hope," said her husband, addressing the crowd, "that you will see
      her on her knees, weeping and groaning, and squalling like a drenched cat.
      She would deceive anybody who was fool enough to believe her, but I have
      suspected her for a long time past. Now I am going to unlock the bin, and
      I beg you, gentlemen, to lay hands on the scoundrel, that he escape us
      not, for he is strong and bold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have no fear!" they cried in chorus. "We will give a good account of
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With that they drew their swords, and brandished their hammers to knock
      down the poor lover, and they shouted to him,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confess your sins! for you will never have a priest nearer you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother and sisters, not wishing to witness the murder, drew on one
      side, and then the good man opened the bin, and as soon as the ass saw the
      light, it began to bray so hideously that the boldest person there was
      affrighted.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when they saw that it was an ass, and that they had been befooled,
      they cursed the merchant, and showered more abuse on him than ever St.
      Peter had praise, and even the women inveighed against him. In fact, if he
      had not fled, his wife's brothers would have killed him, in revenge for
      the blame and dishonour he had wrongly tried to bring on the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was such ado between him and his wife's family that peace had to be
      made between them by the chief burghers of the town, and this was not
      effected without much trouble, and many demands on the part of her
      friends, and many strict promises on his part. But ever after that he was
      all kindness and consideration, and never did a man conduct himself better
      to his wife than he did all his life; and thus they passed their days
      together.

      STORY THE SIXTY-SECOND &mdash; THE LOST RING.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Commesuram.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of two friends, one of whom left a diamond in the bed of his hostess,
        where the other found it, from which there arose a great discussion
        between them, which the husband of the said hostess settled in an
        effectual manner.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      About the month of July (*) a great meeting and assembly was held between
      Calais and Gravelines, and near the castle of Oye, at which were assembled
      many princes and great lords, both of France and of England, to consider
      the question of the ransom of the Duke of Orléans, (**) then prisoner to
      the king of England. Amongst the English representatives was the Cardinal
      of Winchester, who had come to the said assembly in great and noble state,
      with many knights, and squires and ecclesiastics.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) 1440.

     (**) Charles, Duke of Orléans, was taken prisoner at the
     battle of Agincourt in 1415, and, as his ransom was not
     forthcoming was detained a captive for 25 years, when the
     Duke and Duchess of Burgundy intervened to procure his
     freedom. Cardinal Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, accepted a
     ransom of 200,000 gold crowns, payment of which was
     guaranteed by the Dauphin of France, Duke Philip of
     Burgundy, and other princes, with the consent of the King of
     France.   The agreement was signed 22 Nov. 1440.
</pre>
    <p>
      And amongst the other noblemen were two named John Stockton, squire, and
      carver, and Thomas Brampton, cup-bearer to the said Cardinal&mdash;which
      said John and Thomas loved each other like two brothers, for their
      clothes, harness, and arms were always as nearly alike as possible, and
      they usually shared the same room and the said bed, and never was there
      heard any quarrel, dispute, or misunderstanding between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the said Cardinal arrived at the said town of Calais, there was hired
      for him to lodge the said noblemen, the house of Richard Fery, which is
      the largest house in the town of Calais, and it is the custom of all great
      lords passing through the town to lodge there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The said Richard was married to a Dutchwoman; who was beautiful,
      courteous, and well accustomed to receive guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the treaty was being discussed, which was for more than two months,
      John Stockton and Thomas Brampton, who were both of the age of 26 or 28
      years, wore bright crimson clothes, (*) and were ready for feats of arms
      by night or day&mdash;during this time, I say, notwithstanding the
      intimacy and friendship which existed between these two brothers-in-arms,
      the said John Stockton, unknown to the said Thomas, found means to visit
      their hostess, and often conversed with her, and paid her many of those
      attentions customary in love affairs, and finally was emboldened to ask
      the said hostess if he might be her friend, and she would be his
      lady-love.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) Shakespeare several times in the course of the First
     Part of Henry VI mentions "the tawny robes of Winchester."
     Which is right?
</pre>
    <p>
      To which, as though pretending to be astonished at such a request, she
      replied coldly that she did not hate him, or anyone, nor wish to, but that
      she loved all the world as far as in honour she could, but if she rightly
      understood his request, she could not comply with it without great danger
      of dishonour and scandal, and perhaps risk to her life, and for nothing in
      the world would she consent thereto.
    </p>
    <p>
      John replied that she might very well grant his request, for that he would
      rather perish, and be tormented in the other world, than that she should
      be dishonoured by any fault of his, and that she was in no wise to suspect
      that her honour would not be safe in his keeping, and he again begged her
      to grant him this favour, and always deem him her servant and loving
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pretended to tremble, and replied that truly he made all the blood
      freeze in her veins, such fear and dread had she of doing that which he
      asked. Then he approached her and requested a kiss, which the ladies and
      damsels of the said country of England are ready enough to grant, (*) and
      kissing her, begged her tenderly not to be afraid, for no person living
      should ever be made acquainted with what passed between them.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) Is this a libel on the English ladies of the 16th
     century, or is it true&mdash;as Bibliophile Jacob asserts in the
     foot-note to this passage&mdash;that "English prudery is a
     daughter of the Reformation?"
</pre>
    <p>
      Then she said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see that there is no escape, and that I must do as you wish, and as
      this must be so, in order to guard my honour, let me tell you that a
      regulation has been made by all the lords now living in Calais that every
      householder shall watch one night a week on the town walls. But as my
      husband has done so much, either himself or by his friends, for the lords
      and noblemen of the Cardinal, your master, who lodge here, he has only to
      watch half the night, and he will do so on Thursday next, from the time
      the bell rings in the evening until midnight; and whilst my husband is
      away on his watch, if you have anything to say to me, you will find me in
      my chamber, quite willing to listen to you, and along with my maid;"&mdash;who
      was quite ready to perform whatever her mistress wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Stockton was much pleased with this answer, and thanked his hostess,
      and told her that it would not be his fault if he did not come at the
      appointed hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conversation took place on the Monday, after dinner. But it should
      here be stated that Thomas Brampton had, unknown to his friend John
      Stockton, made similar requests to their hostess, but she would not grant
      his desire, but now raised his hopes and then dashed them to the ground,
      saying that he must have but a poor idea of her virtue, and that, if she
      did what he wished, she was sure that her husband and his relations and
      friends would take her life.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Thomas replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My beloved mistress and hostess, I am a nobleman, and for no
      consideration would I bring upon you blame or dishonour, or I should be
      unworthy of the name of a gentleman. Believe me, that I would guard your
      honour as I do my own, and would rather die than reveal your secret; and
      that there is no friend or other person in the world, however dear to me,
      to whom I would relate our love-affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      She, therefore, noting the great affection and desire of the said Thomas,
      told him, on the Wednesday following the day on which she had given John
      the gracious reply recorded above&mdash;that, as he had a great desire to
      do her any service, she would not be so ungrateful as not to repay him.
      And then she told him how it was arranged that her husband should watch
      the morrow night, like the other chief householders of the town, in
      compliance with the regulation made by the lords then staying in Calais.
      But as&mdash;thank God&mdash;her husband had powerful friends to speak to
      the Cardinal for him, he had only to watch half the night, that is to say
      from midnight till the morning, and that if Thomas wished to speak to her
      during that time, she would gladly hear him, but, for God's sake let him
      come so secretly that no blame could attach to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas replied that he desired nothing better, and with that he took leave
      of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow, which was Thursday, at vespers, after the bell had rung for
      the watch, John Stockton did not forget to appear at the hour his hostess
      had appointed. He went to her chamber, and found her there quite alone,
      and she received him and made him welcome, for the table was laid.
    </p>
    <p>
      John requested that he might sup with her, that they might the better talk
      together,&mdash;which she would not at first grant, saying that it might
      cause scandal if he were found with her. But she finally gave way, and the
      supper&mdash;which seemed to John to take a long time&mdash;being
      finished, he embraced his hostess, and they enjoyed themselves together,
      both naked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he entered the chamber, he had put on one of his fingers, a gold
      ring set with a large fine diamond, of the value of, perhaps, thirty
      nobles. And in playing together, the ring slipped from his finger in the
      bed without his knowing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was about 11 o'clock, the damsel begged him kindly to dress and
      leave, that he might not be found by her husband, whom she expected as
      soon as midnight sounded, and that he would guard her honour as he had
      promised.
    </p>
    <p>
      He, supposing that her husband would return soon, rose, dressed, and left
      the chamber as soon as the clock struck twelve, and without remembering
      the diamond he had left in the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far from the door of the chamber John Stockton met Thomas Brampton,
      whom he mistook for his host, Richard. Thomas,&mdash;who had come at the
      hour the lady appointed,&mdash;made a similar mistake, and took John
      Stockton for Richard, and waited a few moments to see which way he would
      go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having watched the other disappear, Thomas went to the chamber, found the
      door ajar, and entered. The lady pretended to be much frightened and
      alarmed, and asked Thomas, with doubt and fear, whether he had met her
      husband who had just left to join the watch? He replied that he had met a
      man, but did not know whether it was her husband or another, and had
      waited a little in order to see which way he would go.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she heard this, she kissed him boldly, and told him he was welcome,
      and Thomas, without more ado, laid her on the bed and tumbled her. When
      she found what manner of man he was, she made haste to undress, and he
      also, and they both got into bed, and sacrificed to the god of love, and
      broke several lances.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in performing these feats, Thomas met with an adventure, for he
      suddenly felt under his thigh, the diamond that John Stockton had left
      there, and without saying anything, or evincing any surprise, he picked it
      up, and put it on his finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      They remained together until the morning, when the watch bell was about to
      ring, when, at the request of the damsel he rose, but before he left they
      embraced with a long, loving kiss. He had scarcely gone when Richard came
      off the watch, on which he had been all night, very cold and sleepy, and
      found his wife just getting up. She made him a fire, and then he went to
      bed, for he had worked all night,&mdash;and so had his wife though not in
      the same fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the custom of the English, after they have heard Mass, to breakfast
      at a tavern, with the best wine; and about two days after these events,
      John and Thomas were in a company of other gentlemen and merchants, who
      were breakfasting together, and Stockton and Brampton were seated opposite
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst they were eating, John looked at Thomas, and saw on one of his
      fingers the diamond. He gazed at it a long time, and came to the
      conclusion that it was the ring he had lost, he did not know where or
      when, and he begged Thomas to show him the diamond, who accordingly handed
      it to him, and when he had it in his hand he saw that it was his own, and
      told Thomas so, and asked him how he came by it. To this Thomas replied
      that it belonged to <i>him</i>. Stockton maintained, on the contrary, that
      he had lost it but a short time before, and that if Thomas had found it in
      the chamber where they slept, it was not right of him to keep it,
      considering the affection and fraternity which had always existed between
      them. High words ensued, and both were angry and indignant with each
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas wished to get the diamond back, but could not obtain it. When the
      other gentlemen and merchants heard the dispute, all tried to bring about
      a reconciliation, but it was no good, for he who had lost the diamond
      would not let it out of his hands, and he who had found it wanted it back,
      as a memento of his love-encounter with his mistress, so that it was
      difficult to settle the dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, one of the merchants, seeing that all attempts to make up the
      quarrel were useless, said that he had hit upon a plan with which both
      John and Thomas ought to be satisfied, but he would not say what it was
      unless both parties promised, under a penalty of ten nobles, to abide by
      what he said. All the company declared that the merchant had spoken well,
      and persuaded John and Thomas to abide by this decision, which they at
      last consented to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merchant ordered the diamond to be placed in his hands, then that all
      those who had tried to settle the difference should be silent, and that
      they should leave the house where they were, and the first man they met,
      whatever his rank or condition should be told the whole matter of the
      dispute between the said John and Thomas, and, whatever he decided, his
      verdict should be accepted without demur by both parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon all the company left the house, and the first person they met
      was Richard, the host of both disputants, to whom the merchant narrated
      the whole of the dispute.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard&mdash;after he had heard all, and had asked those, who were
      present if the account was correct, and the two were unwilling to let this
      dispute be settled by so many notable persons,&mdash;delivered his verdict&mdash;namely
      that the diamond should remain his, and that neither of the parties should
      have it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Thomas saw himself deprived of the diamond he had found, he was much
      vexed; and most probably so also was John Stockton, who had lost it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Thomas requested all the company, except their host, to return to the
      house where they had breakfasted, and he would give them a dinner in order
      that they might hear how the diamond had come into his hands, to which
      they all agreed. And whilst the dinner was being prepared, he related the
      conversation he had had with his hostess, how she had appointed him an
      hour for him to visit her, whilst her husband was out with the watch, and
      how the diamond was found.
    </p>
    <p>
      When John Stockton heard this he was astonished, and declared that exactly
      the same had occurred to him, and on the same night, and that he was
      convinced that he must have dropped his diamond where Thomas had found it,
      and that it was far worse for him to lose it than it was for Thomas, for
      it had cost him dear, whereas Thomas had lost nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Thomas replied that he ought not to complain that their host had
      adjudged it to be his, considering what their hostess had had to suffer,
      and that he (John) had had first innings, whilst Thomas had had to act as
      his page or squire, and come after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So John Stockton was tolerably reconciled to the loss of his ring, since
      he could not otherwise help it. And all those who were present laughed
      loudly at the story of this adventure; and after they had all dined, each
      returned whithersoever he wished.

      STORY THE SIXTY-THIRD &mdash; MONTBLERU; OR THE THIEF. <a
      href="#linklinknote-63" name="linklinknoteref-63" id="linklinknoteref-63">63</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By G. De Montbleru.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of one named Montbleru, who at a fair at Antwerp stole from his
        companions their shirts and handkerchiefs, which they had given to the
        servant-maid of their hostess to be washed; and how afterwards they
        pardoned the thief, and then the said Montbleru told them the whole of
        the story.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Montbleru found himself about two years ago at the fair of Antwerp, in the
      company of Monseigneur d'Estampes, who paid all his expenses&mdash;which
      was much to the liking of Montbleru.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day amongst others, by chance he met Masters Ymbert de Playne, Roland
      Pipe, and Jehan Le Tourneur, who were having a merry time; and as he is
      pleasant and obliging, as everyone knows, they desired his company, and
      begged him to come and lodge with them, and then they would have a merrier
      time than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Montbleru at first excused himself, on the ground that he ought not to
      quit Monseigneur d'Estampes who had brought him there;
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there is a very good reason," he said, "for he pays all my expenses."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, he was willing to leave Monseigneur d'Estampes if the others
      would pay his expenses, and they, who desired nothing better than his
      company, willingly and heartily agreed to this. And now hear how he paid
      them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      These three worthy lords, Masters Ymbert, Roland, and Jehan Le Tourneur,
      stayed at Antwerp longer than they expected when they left Court, and each
      had brought but one shirt, and these and their handkerchiefs etc. became
      dirty, which was a great inconvenience to them, for the weather was very
      hot, it being Pentecost. So they gave them to the servant-maid at their
      lodgings to wash, one Saturday night when they went to bed, and they were
      to have them clean the following morning when they rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Montbleru was on the watch. When the morning came, the maid, who had
      washed the shirts and handkerchiefs, and dried them, and folded them
      neatly and nicely, was called away by her mistress to go to the butcher to
      seek provisions for the dinner. She did as her mistress ordered, and left
      all these clothes in the kitchen, on a stool, expecting to find them on
      her return, but in this she was disappointed, for Montbleru, when he awoke
      and saw it was day, got out of bed, and putting on a dressing gown over
      his shirt, went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went into the kitchen, where there was not a living soul, but only the
      shirts, handkerchiefs, and other articles, asking to be taken. Montbleru
      saw his opportunity, and took them, but was much puzzled to know where he
      could hide them. Once he thought of putting them amongst the big copper
      pots and pans which were in the kitchen; then of hiding them up his
      sleeve; but finally he concealed them in the hay in the stable, with a big
      heap of straw on the top, and that being done, he returned to bed and lay
      down by the side of Jehan Le Tourneur.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the servant maid came back from the butcher's, she could not find the
      shirts, at which she was much vexed, and she asked everybody she met if
      they had seen them? They all told her they knew nothing about them, and
      God knows what a time she had. Then came the servants of these worthy
      lords, who expected the shirts and were afraid to go to their masters
      without them, and grew angry because the shirts could not be found, and so
      did the host, and the hostess, and the maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was about nine o'clock, these good lords called their servants,
      but none of them answered, for they were afraid to tell their masters
      about the loss of their shirts; but at last, however, when it was between
      11 and 12 o'clock, the host came, and the servants, and told the gentlemen
      how their shirts had been stolen, at which news two of them&mdash;Masters
      Ymbert and Roland&mdash;lost patience, but Jehan Le Tourneur took it
      easily, and did nothing but laugh, and called Montbleru, who pretended to
      be asleep, but who heard and knew all, and said to him,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Montbleru, we are all in a nice mess. They have stolen our shirts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holy Mary! what do you say?" replied Montbleru, pretending to be only
      just awake. "That is bad news."
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had discussed the robbery of their shirts for a long time&mdash;Montbleru
      well knew who was the thief&mdash;these worthy lords said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is late, and we have not yet heard Mass, and it is Sunday, and we
      cannot very well go without a shirt. What is to be done?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath!" said the host, "I know of nothing better than to lend you
      each one of my shirts, such as they are. They are not as good as yours,
      but they are clean, and there is nothing better to be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were obliged to take their host's shirts which were too short and too
      small, and made of hard, rough linen, and God knows they were a pretty
      sight in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were soon ready, thank God, but it was so late that they did not know
      where they could hear Mass. Then said Montbleru, in his familiar way,
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for hearing Mass, it is too late to-day; but I know a church in this
      town where at least, we shall not fail to see God."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is better than nothing," said the worthy lords. "Come, come! let us
      get away, for it is very late, and to lose our shirts, and not to hear
      Mass to-day would be a double misfortune; and it is time we went to church
      if we want to hear Mass."
    </p>
    <p>
      Montbleru took them to the principal church in Antwerp, where there is a
      God on an ass (*).
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) A picture or bas-relief, representing Christ's entry
     into Jerusalem, is probably meant.
</pre>
    <p>
      When they had each said a paternoster, they said to Montbleru, "Where
      shall we see God?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will show you," he replied. Then he showed them God mounted on an ass,
      and added, "You will never fail to find Him here at whatever hour you
      come."
    </p>
    <p>
      They began to laugh in spite of the discomfort their shirts caused them.
      Then they went back to dinner, and were after that I know not how many
      days at Antwerp, and left without their shirts, for Montbleru had hidden
      them in a safe place, and afterwards sold them for five gold crowns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now God so willed that in the first week of Lent, Montbleru was at dinner
      with the three worthy gentlemen before named, and in the course of his
      talk he reminded them of the shirts they had lost at Antwerp, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, the poor thief who robbed you will be damned for that, unless God
      and you pardon him. Do you bear him any ill-will?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God!" said Master Ymbert, "my dear sir, I have thought no more about
      it,&mdash;I had forgotten it long since."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least," said Montbleru, "you pardon him, do you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John!" he replied, "I would not have him damned for my sake."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath, that is well said," answered Montbleru. "And you Master
      Roland,&mdash;do you also pardon him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      After a good deal of trouble, he agreed to pardon the thief, but as the
      theft rankled in his mind, he found the word hard to pronounce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And will you also pardon him, Master Roland?" said Montbleru. "What will
      you gain by having a poor thief damned for a wretched shirt and
      handkerchief?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly I pardon him," said he. "He is quit as far as I am concerned, since
      there is nothing else to be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath, you are a good man," said Montbleru.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the turn of Jehan Le Tourneur. Montbleru said to him,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, Jehan, you will not be worse than the others. Everything will be
      pardoned to this poor stealer of shirts unless you object."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't object," he replied. "I have long since pardoned him, and I will
      give him absolution into the bargain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could not say more," rejoined Montbleru, "and by my oath I am greatly
      obliged to you for having pardoned the thief who stole your shirts, as far
      as I personally am concerned, for I am the thief who stole your shirts at
      Antwerp. So I profit by your free pardon, and thank you for it, as I ought
      to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Montbleru confessed this theft, and had been forgiven by all the
      party as you have heard, it need not be asked if Masters Ymbert, Roland,
      and Jehan Le Tourneur were astonished, for they had never suspected that
      it was Montbleru who had played that trick upon them, and they reproached
      him playfully with the theft. But he, knowing his company, excused himself
      cleverly for having played such a joke upon them, and told them that it
      was his custom to take whatever he found unprotected,&mdash;especially
      with people like them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They only laughed, but asked him how he had managed to effect the theft,
      and he told them the whole story, and said also that he had made five
      crowns out of his booty, after which they asked him no more.

      STORY THE SIXTY-FOURTH &mdash; THE OVER-CUNNING CURÉ. <a
      href="#linklinknote-64" name="linklinknoteref-64" id="linklinknoteref-64">64</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Michault De Changy.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a priest who would have played a joke upon a gelder named
        Trenche-couille, but, by the connivance of his host, was himself
        castrated.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      There formerly lived in this country, in a place that I have a good reason
      for not mentioning (if any should recognise it, let him be silent as I am)
      a curé who was over-fond of confessing his female parishioners. In fact,
      there was not one who had not had to do with him, especially the young
      ones&mdash;for the old he did not care.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had long carried on this holy life and virtuous exercise, and his
      fame had spread through all the country round, he was punished in the way
      that you will hear, by one of his parishioners, to whom, however, he had
      done nothing concerning his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one day at dinner, and enjoying himself, at the inn kept by his
      parishioner, and as they were in the midst of their dinner, there came a
      man named Trenchecouille, whose business it was to cut cattle, pull teeth,
      and other matters, and who had come to the inn for one of these purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host received him well, and asked him to sit down, and, without being
      much pressed, he sat down with the curé and the others, to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curé, who was a great joker, began to talk to this gelder and asked
      him a hundred thousand questions about his business, and the gelder
      replied as he best could.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end, the curé turned to the host, and whispered in his ear,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we play a trick upon this gelder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, let us," replied the host. "But how shall we do it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath," said the curé, "we will play him a pretty trick, if you will
      help me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite willing," replied the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell you what we will do," said the curé. "I will pretend to have
      a pain in the testicle, and bargain with him to cut it out; then I will be
      bound and laid on the table all ready, and when he comes near to cut me, I
      will jump up and show him my backside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is well said," replied my host, who at once saw what he had to do.
      "We shall never hit on anything better. We will all help you with the
      joke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said the curé.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the curé began again to rally the gelder, and at last told him
      that he had want of a man like him, for that he had a testicle all
      diseased and rotten, and would like to find a man who would extract it,
      and he said it so quietly and calmly that the gelder believed him, and
      replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monsieur le curé, I would have you know that without either disparaging
      myself or boasting, there is not a man in this country who can do the job
      better than I can, and for the sake of the host here, I will do my best to
      satisfy you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, that is well said;" replied the curé.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, all was agreed, and when the dinner had been removed, the gelder
      began to make his preparations, and on the other hand the curé prepared to
      play the practical joke, (which was to turn out no joke for him) and told
      the host and the others what they were to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst these preparations were being made on both sides, the host went to
      the gelder, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care, and, whatever the priest may say, cut out both his testicles,
      clean,&mdash;and fail not, if you value your carcass."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. Martin, I will," replied the gelder, "since you wish it. I have
      ready a knife so sharp that I will present you with his testicles before
      he has time to say a word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall see what you can do," said the host, "but if you fail, I will
      never again have anything to do with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      All being ready, the table was brought, and the curé, in his doublet,
      pretended to be in great pain, and promised a bottle of good wine to the
      gelder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host and his servants laid hold of the curé so that he could not get
      away, and for better security they tied him tightly, and told him that was
      to make the joke better, and that they would let him go when he wished,
      and he like a fool believed them. Then came the brave gelder, having a
      little rasor concealed in his hand, and began to feel the cure's
      testicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the devil's name," said the curé, "do it well and with one cut. Touch
      them first as you can, and afterwards I will tell you which one I want
      taken out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," he replied, and lifting up the shirt, took hold of the
      testicles, which were big and heavy and without enquiring which was the
      bad one, cut them both out at a single stroke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good curé began to yell, and make more ado than ever man made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, hallo!" said the host; "have patience. What is done, is done. Let
      us bandage you up."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gelder did all that was necessary, and then went away, expecting a
      handsome present from the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      It need not be said that the curé was much grieved at this deprivation,
      and he reviled the host, who was the cause of the mischief, but God knows
      he excused himself well, and said that if the gelder had not disappeared
      so quickly, he would have served him so that he would never have cut any
      one again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you imagine," he said, "I am greatly grieved at your misfortune, and
      still more that it should have happened in my inn."
    </p>
    <p>
      The news soon spread through the town, and it need not be said that many
      damsels were vexed to find themselves deprived of the cure's instrument,
      but on the other hand the long-suffering husbands were so happy that I
      could neither speak nor write the tenth part of their joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, as you have heard, was the curé, who had deceived and duped so many
      others, punished. Never after that did he dare to show himself amongst
      men, but soon afterwards ended in grief and seclusion his miserable life.

    <h2>
      STORY THE SIXTY-FIFTH &mdash; INDISCRETION REPROVED, BUT NOT PUNISHED.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By The Provost Of Wastennes.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a woman who heard her husband say that an innkeeper at Mont St.
        Michel was excellent at copulating, so went there, hoping to try for
        herself, but her husband took means to prevent it, at which she was much
        displeased, as you will hear shortly.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Often a man says things for which he is sorry afterwards, and so it
      happened formerly that a good fellow who lived in a village near Mont St.
      Michel, talked one night at a supper, at which were present his wife, and
      several strangers and neighbours, of an inn-keeper of Mont St. Michel, and
      declared, affirmed, and swore on his honour, that this inn-keeper had the
      finest, biggest, and thickest member in all the country round, and could
      use it so well that four, five, or six times cost him no more trouble than
      taking off his hat. All those who were at table listened to this
      favourable account of the prowess of mine host of Mont St. Michel, and
      made what remarks they pleased about it, but the person who took the most
      notice was the lady of the house, the wife of the man who related the
      story, who had listened attentively, and to whom it seemed that a woman
      would be most happy and fortunate who had a husband so endowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she also thought in her heart that if she could devise some cunning
      excuse she would some day go to Mont St. Michel, and put up at the inn
      kept by the man with the big member, and it would not be her fault if she
      did not try whether the report were true.
    </p>
    <p>
      To execute what she had so boldly devised, at the end of six or eight days
      she took leave of her husband, to go on a pilgrimage to Mont St. Michel;
      and she invented some clever excuse for her journey, as women well know
      how to do. Her husband did not refuse her permission to go, though he had
      his suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      At parting, her husband told her to make an offering to Saint Michael, and
      that she was to lodge at the house of the said landlord, and he
      recommended her to him a hundred thousand times.
    </p>
    <p>
      She promised to accomplish all he ordered, and upon that took leave and
      went away, much desiring, God knows, to find herself at Mont St. Michel.
      As soon as she had left, the husband mounted his horse, and went as fast
      as he could, by another road to that which his wife had taken, to Mont St.
      Michel, and arrived secretly, before his wife, at the inn kept by the man
      already mentioned, who most gladly welcomed him. When he was in his
      chamber, he said to his host,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My host, you and I have been friends for a long time. I will tell you
      what has brought me to your town now. About five or six days ago, a lot of
      good fellows were having supper at my house, and amongst other talk, I
      related how it was said throughout the country that there was no man
      better furnished than you"&mdash;and then he told him as nearly as
      possible all that had been said. "And it happened," he continued, "that my
      wife listened attentively to what I said, and never rested till she
      obtained permission to come to this town. And by my oath, I verily suspect
      that her chief intention is to try if she can, if my words were true that
      I said about your big member. She will soon be here I expect, for she
      longs to come; so I pray you when she does come you will receive her
      gladly, and welcome her, and do all that she asks. But at all events do
      not deceive me; take care that you do not touch her. Appoint a time to
      come to her when she is in bed, and I will go in your place, and
      afterwards I will tell you some good news."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me alone," said the host. "I will take care and act my part well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "At all events," said the other, "be sure and serve me no trick, for I
      know well enough that she will be ready to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath," said the host, "I assure you I will not come near her," and
      he did not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after came our wench and her maid, both very tired, God knows; and
      the good host came forth, and received his guests as he had been enjoined,
      and as he had promised. He caused mademoiselle to be taken to a fair
      chamber, and a good fire to be made, and brought the best wine in the
      house, and sent for some fine fresh cherries, and came to banquet with her
      whilst supper was getting ready. When he saw his opportunity, he began to
      make his approaches to her, but in a roundabout way. To cut matters short,
      an agreement was made between them that he should come secretly at
      midnight to sleep with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This being arranged, he went and told the husband of the dame, who, at the
      hour named, went in mine host's instead, and did the best he could, and
      rose before daybreak and returned to his own bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was day, the wench, quite vexed and melancholy, called her maid,
      and they rose, and dressed as hastily as they could, and would have paid
      the host, but he said he would take nothing from her. And with that she
      left without hearing Mass, or seeing St. Michael, or breakfasting either;
      and without saying a single word, returned home. But you must know that
      her husband was there already, and asked her what good news there was at
      Mont St. Michel. She, feeling as annoyed as she could be, hardly deigned
      to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what sort of welcome," asked her husband, "did mine host give you? By
      God, he is a good fellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A good fellow!" she said. "Nothing very wonderful! I will not give him
      more praise than is his due."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, dame?" he replied. "By St. John, I should have thought that for love
      of me he would have given you a hearty welcome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care not about his welcome," she said. "I do not go on a pilgrimage for
      the sake of his, or any one else's welcome. I only think of my devotion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Devotion, wife!" he answered. "By Our Lady, you had none! I know very
      well why you are so vexed and sorrowful. You did not find what you
      expected&mdash;that is the exact truth. Ha, ha, madam! I know the cause of
      your pilgrimage. You wanted to make trial of the physical gifts of our
      host of St. Michel, but, by St. John, I was on my guard, and always will
      be if I can help it. And that you may not think that I lied when I told
      you that he had such a big affair, by God, I said nothing but what is
      true. But you wanted something more than hearsay evidence, and, if I had
      not stopped you, you would in your 'devotion' have tried its power for
      yourself. You see I know all, and to remove any doubts you may have on the
      subject, I may tell you that I came last night at the appointed hour, and
      took his place&mdash;so be content with what I was able to do, and remain
      satisfied with what you have. This time I pardon you, but take care that
      it never occurs again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The damsel, confused and astonished at being thus caught, as soon as she
      could speak, begged his pardon, and promised never to do anything of the
      sort again. And I believe that she never did.

    <h2>
      STORY THE SIXTY-SIXTH &mdash; THE WOMAN AT THE BATH.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Philippe De Laon.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of an inn-keeper at Saint Omer who put to his son a question for
        which he was afterwards sorry when he heard the reply, at which his wife
        was much ashamed, as you will hear, later.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Some time ago I was at Saint Omer with a number of noble companions, some
      from the neighbourhood and Boulogne, and some from elsewhere, and after a
      game of tennis, we went to sup at the inn of a tavern-keeper, who is a
      well-to-do man and a good fellow, and who has a very pretty and buxom
      wife, by whom he has a fine boy, of the age of six or seven years.
    </p>
    <p>
      We were all seated at supper, the inn-keeper, his wife, and her son, who
      stood near her, being with us, and some began to talk, others to sing and
      make good cheer, and our host did his best to make himself agreeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife had been that day to the warm baths, and her little son with her.
      So our host thought, to make the company laugh, to ask his son about the
      people who were at the baths with his mother, (*) and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, my son, and tell me truly which of all the women at the baths
      had the finest and the biggest c&mdash;&mdash;?"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) The public baths were then much frequented, especially
     by the lower classes.   Men, women, and children all bathed
     together.
</pre>
    <p>
      The child being questioned before his mother, whom he feared as children
      usually do, looked at her, and did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father, not expecting to find him so quiet, said again;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell me, my son; who had the biggest c&mdash;&mdash; Speak boldly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, father," replied the child, still glancing at his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, you lie," said his father. "Tell me! I want to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I dare not," said the boy, "my mother would beat me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, she will not," said the father. "You need not mind. I will see she
      does not hurt you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our hostess, the boy's mother, not thinking that her son would tell (as he
      did) said to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Answer boldly what your father asks you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will beat me," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I will not," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The father, now that the boy had permission to speak, again asked;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, my son, on your word, did you look at the c&mdash;&mdash;s of all
      the women who were at the baths?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John, yes, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were there plenty of them? Speak, and don't lie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never saw so many. It seemed a real warren of c&mdash;&mdash;s."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then; tell us now who had the finest and the biggest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly," replied the boy, "mother had the finest and biggest&mdash;but <i>he</i>
      had such a large nose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such a large nose?" said the father. "Go along, go along! you are a good
      boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      We all began to laugh and to drink, and to talk about the boy who
      chattered so well. But his mother did not know which way to look, she was
      so ashamed, because her son had spoken about a nose, and I expect that he
      was afterwards well beaten for having told tales out of school. Our host
      was a good fellow, but he afterwards repented having put a question the
      answer to which made him blush. That is all for the present.

      STORY THE SIXTY-SEVENTH &mdash; THE WOMAN WITH THREE HUSBANDS.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Philippe De Laon.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a "fur hat" of Paris, who wished to deceive a cobbler's wife, but
        over-reached, himself, for he married her to a barber, and thinking that
        he was rid of her, would have wedded another, but she prevented him, as
        you will hear more plainly hereafter.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      About three years ago a noteworthy adventure happened to one of the fur
      hats of the Parliament of Paris. (*) And that it should not be forgotten,
      I relate this story, not that I hold all the "fur caps" to be good and
      upright men; but because there was not a little, but a large measure of
      duplicity about this particular one, which is a strange and peculiar thing
      as every one knows.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) The councillors of Parliament wore a cap of fur,
     bordered with ermine.
</pre>
    <p>
      To come to my story, this fur hat,&mdash;that is to say this councillor of
      Parliament,&mdash;fell in love with the wife of a cobbler of Paris,&mdash;a
      good, and pretty woman, and ready-witted. The fur hat managed, by means of
      money and other ways, to get an interview with the cobbler's fair wife on
      the quiet and alone, and if he had been enamoured of her before he enjoyed
      her, he was still more so afterwards, which she perceived and was on her
      guard, and resolved to stand off till she obtained her price.
    </p>
    <p>
      His love for her was at such fever heat, that by commands, prayers,
      promises, and gifts, he tried to make her come to him, but she would not,
      in order to aggravate and increase his malady. He sent ambassadors of all
      sorts to his mistress, but it was no good&mdash;she would rather die than
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally&mdash;to shorten the story&mdash;in order to make her come to him
      as she used formerly to do, he promised her in the presence of three or
      four witnesses, that he would take her to wife if her husband died.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she obtained this promise, she consented to visit him at
      various times when she could get away, and he continued to be as love-sick
      as ever. She, knowing her husband to be old, and having the aforesaid
      promise, already looked upon herself as the Councillor's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      But a short time afterwards, the much-desired death of the cobbler was
      known and published, and his fair widow at once went with a bound to the
      abode of the fur cap, who received her gladly, and again promised to make
      her his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      These two good people&mdash;the fur cap, and his mistress, the cobbler's
      widow&mdash;were now together; But it often happens that what can be got
      without trouble is not worth the trouble of getting, and so it was in this
      case, for our fur cap soon began to weary of the cobbler's widow, and his
      love for her grew cold. She often pressed him to perform the marriage he
      had promised, but he said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my word, my dear, I can never marry, for I am a churchman, and hold
      such and such benefices, as you know. The promise I formerly made you is
      null and void, and was caused by the great love I bear you, to win you to
      me the more easily."
    </p>
    <p>
      She, believing that he did belong to the Church, and seeing that she was
      as much mistress of his house as though she had been his wedded wife, went
      her accustomed way, and never troubled more about the marriage; but at
      last was persuaded by the fine words of our fur cap to leave him, and
      marry a barber, their neighbour, to whom the Councillor gave 300 gold
      crowns, and God knows that the woman also was well provided with clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that our fur cap had a definite object in arranging this
      marriage, which would never have come off if he had not told his mistress
      that in future he intended to serve God, and live on his benefices, and
      give up everything to the Church. But he did just the contrary, as soon as
      he had got rid of her by marrying her to the barber; for about a year
      later, he secretly treated for the hand of the daughter of a rich and
      notable citizen of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage was agreed to and arranged, and a day fixed for the wedding.
      He also disposed of his benefices, which were only held by simple tonsure.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things were known throughout Paris, and came to the knowledge of the
      cobbler's widow, now the barber's wife, and, as you may guess, she was
      much surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the traitor," she said; "has he deceived me like this? He deserted me
      under pretence of serving God, and made me over to another man. But, by
      Our Lady of Clery, the matter shall not rest here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did it, for she cited our fur cap before the Bishop, and there her
      advocate stated his case clearly and courteously, saying that the fur cap
      had promised the cobbler's wife, in the presence of several witnesses,
      that if her husband died he would make her his wife. When her husband
      died, the Councillor had kept her for about a year, and then handed her
      over to a barber.
    </p>
    <p>
      To shorten the story, the witnesses having been heard, and the case
      debated, the Bishop annulled the marriage of the cobbler's widow to the
      barber, and enjoined and commanded the fur cap to take her as his wife,
      for so she was by right, since he had carnal connection with her after the
      aforesaid promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus was our fur cap brought to his senses. He missed marrying the
      citizen's fair daughter, and lost the 300 crowns, which the barber had for
      keeping his wife for a year. And if the Councillor was ill-pleased to have
      his old mistress again, the barber was glad enough to get rid of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the manner that you have heard, was one of the fur caps of the
      Parliament of Paris once served.

        means to get from her her money, clothes, jewels, and all, down to her
        chemise, and then sent her away in that condition, as shall be
        afterwards recorded.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It is no new and strange thing for wives to make their husbands jealous,&mdash;or
      indeed, by God, cuckolds. And so it happened formerly, in the city of
      Antwerp, that a married woman, who was not the chastest person in the
      world, was desired by a good fellow to do&mdash;you know what. And she,
      being kind and courteous, did not like to refuse the request, but gladly
      consented, and they two continued this life for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, Fortune, tired of always giving them good luck, willed that
      the husband should catch them in the act, much to his own surprise.
      Perhaps though it would be hard to say which was the most surprised&mdash;the
      lover, or his mistress, or the husband. Nevertheless, the lover, with the
      aid of a good sword he had, made his escape without getting any harm.
      There remained the husband and wife, and what they said to each other may
      be guessed. After a few words on both sides, the husband, thinking to
      himself that as she had commenced to sin it would be difficult to break
      her of her bad habits, and that if she did sin again it might come to the
      knowledge of other people, and he might be dishonoured; and considering
      also that to beat or scold her would be only lost labour, determined to
      see if he could not drive her out, and never let her disgrace his house
      again. So he said to his wife;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I see that you are not such as you ought to be; nevertheless,
      hoping that you will never again behave as you have behaved, let no more
      be said. But let us talk of another matter. I have some business on hand
      which concerns me greatly, and you also. We must put in it all our jewels;
      and if you have any little hoard of money stored away, bring it forth, for
      it is required."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath," said the wench, "I will do so willingly, if you will pardon
      me the wrong I have done you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't speak about it," he replied, "and no more will I."
    </p>
    <p>
      She, believing that she had absolution and remission of her sins, to
      please her husband, and atone for the scandal she had caused, gave him all
      the money she had, her gold rings, rich stuffs, certain well-stuffed
      purses, a number of very fine kerchiefs, many whole furs of great value&mdash;in
      short, all that she had, and that her husband could ask, she gave to do
      him pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The devil!" quoth he; "still I have not enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had everything, down to the gown and petticoat she wore, he said,
      "I must have that gown."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" said she. "I have nothing else to wear. Do you want me to go
      naked?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must," he said, "give it me, and the petticoat also, and be quick
      about it, for either by good-will or force, I must have them."
    </p>
    <p>
      She, knowing that force was not on her side, stripped off her gown and
      petticoat, and stood in her chemise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" she said; "Have I done what pleases you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not always," he replied. "If you obey me now, God knows you do so
      willingly&mdash;but let us leave that and talk of another matter. When I
      married you, you brought scarcely anything with you, and the little that
      you had you have dissipated or forfeited. There is no need for me to speak
      of your conduct&mdash;you know better than anyone what you are, and being
      what you are, I hereby renounce you, and say farewell to you for ever!
      There is the door! go your way; and if you are wise, you will never come
      into my presence again."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor wench, more astounded than ever, did not dare to stay after this
      terrible reproof, so she left, and went, I believe, to the house of her
      lover, for the first night, and sent many ambassadors to try and get back
      her apparel and belongings, but it was no avail. Her husband was
      headstrong and obstinate, and would never hear her spoken about, and still
      less take her back, although he was much pressed both by his own friends
      and those of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was obliged to earn other clothes, and instead of her husband live
      with a friend until her husband's wrath is appeased, but, up to the
      present, he is still displeased with her, and will on no account see her.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a noble knight of Flanders, who was married to a beautiful and
        noble lady. He was for many years a prisoner in Turkey, during which
        time his good and loving wife was, by the importunities of her friends,
        induced to marry another knight. Soon after she had remarried, she heard
        that her husband had returned from Turkey, whereupon she allowed herself
        to die of grief, because she had contracted a fresh marriage.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It is not only known to all those of the city of Ghent&mdash;where the
      incident that I am about to relate happened not long ago&mdash;but to all
      those of Flanders, and many others, that at the battle fought between the
      King of Hungary and Duke Jehan (whom may God absolve) on one side, and the
      Grand Turk and all his Turks on the other, (*) that many noble knights and
      esquires&mdash;French, Flemish, German, and Picardians&mdash;were taken
      prisoners, of whom some were put to death in the presence of the said
      Great Turk, others were imprisoned for life, and others condemned to
      slavery, amongst which last was a noble knight of the said country of
      Flanders, named Clayz Utenhoven.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) The battle of Nicopolis (28th September, 1396) when
     Sigismond, King of Hungary, and Jean-sans-Peur, son of the
     Duke of Burgundy, who had recruited a large army for the
     purpose of raising the siege of Constantinople, were met and
     overthrown by the Sultan, Bajazet I.
</pre>
    <p>
      For many years he endured this slavery, which was no light task but an
      intolerable martyrdom to him, considering the luxuries upon which he had
      been nourished, and the condition in which he had lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that he had formerly married at Ghent a beautiful and
      virtuous lady, who loved him and held him dear with all her heart, and who
      daily prayed to God that shortly she might see him again if he were still
      alive; and that if he were dead, He would of His grace pardon his sins,
      and include him in the number of those glorious martyrs, who to repel the
      infidel, and that the holy Catholic faith might be exalted, had given up
      their mortal lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      This good lady, who was rich, beautiful, virtuous, and possessed of many
      noble friends, was continually pressed and assailed by her friends to
      remarry; they declaring and affirming that her husband was dead, and that
      if he were alive he would have returned like the others; or if he were a
      prisoner, she would have received notice to prepare his ransom. But
      whatever reasons were adduced, this virtuous lady could not be persuaded
      to marry again, but excused herself as well as she was able.
    </p>
    <p>
      These excuses served her little or nothing, for her relatives and friends
      so pressed her that she was obliged to obey. But God knows that it was
      with no small regret, and after she had been for nine years deprived of
      the presence of her good and loyal husband, whom she believed to be long
      since dead, as did most or all who knew him; but God, who guards and
      preserves his servants and champions, had otherwise ordered it, for he
      still lived and performed his arduous labours as a slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      To return to our story. This virtuous lady was married to another knight,
      and lived with him for half a year, without hearing anything further about
      her first husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the will of God, however, this good and true knight, Messire Clays, who
      was still in Turkey, when his wife married again, and there working as a
      slave, was, by means of some Christian gentlemen and merchants, delivered,
      and returned in their galley.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was on his return, he met and found in passing through various
      places, many of his acquaintance, who were overjoyed at his delivery, for
      in truth he was a most valiant man, of great renown and many virtues; and
      so the most joyful rumour of his much wished-for deliverance spread into
      France, Artois, and Picardy, where his virtues were not less known than
      they were in Flanders, of which country he was a native. And from these
      countries it soon reached Flanders, and came to the ears of his beauteous
      and virtuous lady and spouse, who was astounded thereat, and her feelings
      so overcame her as to deprive her of her senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," she said, as soon as she could speak, "my heart was never willing to
      do that which my relations and friends forced me to do. Alas! what will my
      most loving lord and husband say? I have not kept faith with him as I
      should, but&mdash;like a frail, frivolous, and weak-minded woman,&mdash;have
      given to another part and portion of that of which he alone should be lord
      and master! I cannot, and dare not await his coming. I am not worthy that
      he should look at me, or that I should be seen in his company," and with
      these words her most chaste, virtuous, and loving heart failed her, and
      she fell fainting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was carried and laid upon a bed, and her senses returned to her, but
      from that time it was not in the power of man or woman to make her eat or
      sleep, and thus she continued three days, weeping continually, and in the
      greatest grief of mind that ever woman was. During which time she
      confessed and did all that a good Christian should, and implored pardon of
      all, and most especially of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards she died, which was a great misfortune; and it need not be
      told what grief fell upon the said lord, her husband, when he heard the
      news. His sorrow was such that he was in great danger of dying as his most
      loving wife had done; but God, who had saved him from many other great
      perils, preserved him also from this.

    <h2>
      STORY THE SEVENTIETH &mdash; THE DEVIL'S HORN.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a noble knight of Germany, a great traveller in his time; who
        after he had made a certain voyage, took a vow to never make the sign of
        the Cross, owing to the firm faith and belief that he had in the holy
        sacrament of baptism&mdash;in which faith he fought the devil, as you
        will hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A noble knight of Germany, a great traveller, distinguished in arms,
      courteous, and largely endowed with all good virtues, had just returned
      from a long journey, and was in his castle, when he was asked by one of
      his vassals living in the same town, to be godfather to his child, which
      had been born on the same day that the knight returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      To which request the knight willingly acceded, and although he had during
      his life held many children at the font, he had never before listened to
      the holy words pronounced by the priest at this holy and excellent
      sacrament as he did this time, and they seemed to him&mdash;as indeed they
      are-full of high and divine mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baptism being finished, he being liberal and courteous and willing to
      oblige his vassals, remained to dine in the town, instead of returning to
      his castle, and with him dined the curé, his fellow sponsor, and other
      persons of renown.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discourse turned on various matters, when the knight began to greatly
      praise the excellent sacrament of baptism, and said in a loud and clear
      voice that all might hear;
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I knew for a truth that at my baptism had been pronounced the great
      and holy words which I heard to-day at the baptism of my latest god-son, I
      would not believe that the devil could have any power or authority over
      me, except to tempt me, and I would refrain from ever making the sign of
      the Cross, not that&mdash;let it be well understood&mdash;I do not well
      know that sign is sufficient to repel the devil, but because I believe
      that the words pronounced at the baptism of every Christian (if they are
      such as I have to-day heard) are capable of driving away all the devils of
      hell, however many they might be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly then, monseigneur," replied the curé, "I assure you <i>in verbo
      sacerdotis</i> that the same words which were said to-day at the baptism
      of your god-son were pronounced at your baptism. I know it well, for I
      myself baptised you, and I remember it as well as though it were
      yesterday. God be merciful to monseigneur your father&mdash;he asked me
      the day after your baptism, what I thought of his son; such and such were
      your sponsors, and such and such were present," and he related all
      particulars about the baptism, and showed that it was certain that in not
      a word did it differ from that of his god-son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since it is thus," then said the noble knight, "I vow to God, my creator,
      that I have such firm faith in the holy sacrament of baptism that never
      again, for any danger, encounter, or assault that the devil may make
      against me, will I make the sign of the Cross, but solely by the memory of
      the sacrament of baptism I will drive him behind me; such a firm belief
      have I in this divine mystery, that it does not seem possible to me that
      the devil can hurt a man so shielded, for that rite needs no other aid if
      accompanied by true faith."
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner passed, and I know not how many years after, the good knight
      was in a large town in Germany, about some business which drew him
      thither, and was lodged in an inn. As he was one night along with his
      servants, after supper, talking and jesting with them, he wished to
      retire, but as his servants were enjoying themselves he would not disturb
      them, so he took a candle and went alone. As he entered the closet he saw
      before him a most horrible and terrible monster, having large and long
      horns, eyes brighter than the flames of a furnace, arms thick and long,
      sharp and cutting claws,&mdash;in fact a most extraordinary monster, and a
      devil, I should imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And for such the good knight took it, and was at first greatly startled at
      such a meeting. Nevertheless, he boldly determined to defend himself if he
      were attacked, and he remembered the vow he had made concerning the holy
      and divine mystery of baptism. And in this faith he walked up to the
      monster, whom I have called a devil, and asked him who he was and what he
      wanted?
    </p>
    <p>
      The devil, without a word, attacked him, and the good knight defended
      himself, though he had no other weapons than his hands (for he was in his
      doublet, being about to go to bed) and the protection of his firm faith in
      the holy mystery of baptism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The struggle lasted long, and the good knight was so weary that it was
      strange he could longer endure such an assault. But he was so well-armed
      by his faith that the blows of his enemy had but little effect. At last,
      when the combat had lasted a full hour, the good knight took the devil by
      the horns, and tore one of them out, and beat him therewith soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went away victorious, leaving the devil writhing on the ground,
      and went back to his servants, who were still enjoying themselves, as they
      had been doing when he left. They were much frightened to see their master
      sweating and out of breath, and with his face all scratched, and his
      doublet, shirt, and hose disarranged and torn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, sir," they cried; "whence come you, and who has thus mauled you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who?" he replied. "Why it was the devil, with whom I have fought so long
      that I am out of breath, and in the condition in which you see me; and I
      swear to you that I truly believe he would have strangled and devoured me,
      if I had not at that moment remembered my baptism, and the great mystery
      of that holy sacrament, and the vow that I made I know not how many years
      ago. And, believe me, I have kept that vow, and though I was in danger, I
      never made the sign of the Cross, but remembering the aforesaid holy
      sacrament, boldly defended myself, and have escaped scot free; for which I
      praise and thank our Lord who with the shield of faith hath preserved me
      safely. Let all the other devils in hell come; as long as this protection
      endures, I fear them not. Praise be to our blessed God who is able to
      endue his knights with such weapons."
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants of the good knight, when they heard their master relate this
      story, were very glad to find he had escaped so well, and much astonished
      at the horn he showed them, and which he had torn out of the devil's head.
      And they could not discover, neither could any person who afterwards saw
      it, of what it was formed; if it were bone or horn, as other horns are,
      or, what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then one of the knight's servants said that he would go and see if this
      devil were still where his master had left it, and if he found it he would
      fight it, and tear out its other horn. His master told him not to go, but
      he said he would.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not do it," said his master; "the danger is too great."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care not," replied the other; "I will go."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you take my advice," said his master, "you will not go."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he would disobey his master and go. He took in one hand a torch, and
      in the other a great axe, and went to the place where his master had met
      and fought the devil. What happened no one knows, but his master, who,
      fearing for his servant, followed him as quickly as he could, found
      neither man nor devil, nor ever heard what became of the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in the manner that you have heard, did this good knight fight
      against the devil, and overcome him by the virtue of the holy sacrament of
      baptism.

      STORY THE SEVENTY-FIRST &mdash; THE CONSIDERATE CUCKOLD
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur Le Duc.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a knight of Picardy, who lodged at an inn in the town of St. Omer,
        and fell in love with the hostess, with whom he was amusing himself&mdash;you
        know how&mdash;when her husband discovered them; and how he behaved&mdash;as
        you will shortly hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      At Saint Omer, not long ago, there happened an amusing incident, which is
      as true as the Gospel, and is known to many notable people worthy of faith
      and belief. In short, the story is as follows.
    </p>
    <p>
      A noble knight of Picardy, who was lively and lusty, and a man of great
      authority and high position, came to an inn where the quartermaster of
      Duke Philip of Burgundy had appointed him to lodge. (*)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) The <i>fourrier</i>&mdash;which, for want of a better word, I have
     translated as "quartermaster,"&mdash;was an officer of the
     household of a prince or great lord. One of his duties was
     to provide lodgings for all the retinue whenever his master
     was travelling.
</pre>
    <p>
      As soon as he had jumped off his horse, and put foot to the ground, his
      hostess&mdash;as is the custom in that part of the country&mdash;came
      forward smiling most affably, and received him most honourably, and, as he
      was the most kind and courteous of men, he embraced her and kissed her
      gently, for she was pretty and nice, healthy-looking and nattily dressed&mdash;in
      fact very tempting to kiss and cuddle&mdash;and at first sight each took a
      strong liking to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight wondered by what means he could manage to enjoy the person of
      his hostess, and confided in one of his servants, who in a very short time
      so managed the affair that the two were brought together.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the noble knight saw his hostess ready to listen to whatever he had
      to say, you may fancy that he was joyful beyond measure; and in his great
      haste and ardent desire to discuss the question he wanted to argue with
      her, forgot to shut the door of the room, which his servant, when he
      departed after bringing the woman in, had left half open.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight, without troubling about preludes, began an oration in
      dumb-show; and the hostess, who was not sorry to hear him, replied to his
      arguments in such a manner that they soon agreed well together, and never
      was music sweeter, or instruments in better tune, than it was for those
      two, by God's mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it happened, by I know not what chance, that the host of the inn, the
      husband of the woman, was seeking his wife to tell her something, and
      passing by chance by the chamber where his wife and the knight were
      playing the cymbals, heard the sound. He turned towards the spot where
      this pleasant pastime was going on, and pushing open the door, saw the
      knight and his wife harnessed together, at which he was by far the most
      astonished of the three, and drew back quickly, fearing to prevent and
      disturb the said work which they were performing. But all that he did by
      way of menace or remonstrance was to call out from behind the door;
      "Morbleu! you are not only wicked but thoughtless. Have you not the sense,
      when you want to do anything of that sort, to shut the door behind you?
      Just fancy what it would have been if anyone else had found you! By God,
      you would have been ruined and dishonoured, and your misdeeds discovered
      and known to all the town! In the devil's name, be more careful another
      time!" and without another word, he closed the door and went away; and the
      honest couple re-tuned their bagpipes, and finished the tune they had
      begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when this was finished, each went his or her own way as unconcernedly
      as though nothing had happened; and the circumstance would I believe have
      never been known&mdash;or at least not so publicly as to come to your
      ears, and the ears of so many other people,&mdash;had it not been that the
      husband vexed himself so little about the matter that he thought less of
      being cuckolded than he did of finding the door unbolted.

    <h2>
      STORY THE SEVENTY-SECOND &mdash; NECESSITY IS THE MOTHER OF INVENTION.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Commensuram.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a gentleman of Picardy who was enamoured of the wife of a knight
        his neighbour; and how he obtained the lady's favours and was nearly
        caught with her, and with great difficulty made his escape, as you will
        hear later.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Apropos of the previous story, there lived formerly in Picardy&mdash;and I
      believe he is living there now&mdash;a gentlemen who was so enamoured of
      the wife of a knight, his neighbour, that he deemed no day or hour happy
      if he were not with her, or at least had news of her;&mdash;and he was
      quite as dear to her&mdash;which is no small matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the misfortune was that they could find no means of meeting secretly
      to open their hearts to each other, and in no case would they do so in the
      presence of a third person, however good a friend he or she might be. At
      last, after many sad nights and days, Love, who aids and succours his
      loyal servants when he pleases, procured for them the much-desired day,
      when the poor husband,&mdash;the most jealous man living&mdash;was obliged
      to leave his house on account of some pressing business by which he would
      gain a large sum if he were present, and would lose his money if he were
      absent. By gaining which sum he reaped an even better reward&mdash;that of
      being called a cuckold as well as a jealous man&mdash;for he had no sooner
      left his house than the gentleman, who was watching for no other quarry,
      popped into the house, and without staying long, at once performed that
      for which he came, and received from his lady all that a lover can and
      dare demand; as pleasantly and as leisurely as they could both wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      And they did not suppose that the husband would surprise them, but looked
      forward to a time of unalloyed pleasure, hoping that the night would
      complete that which the most joyful day&mdash;by far too short&mdash;had
      begun, and really believing that the poor devil of a husband could not
      return before dinner-time the following day at the earliest.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it happened otherwise, for the devil brought him home. I know not, and
      care not to know how it was that he could get through his business so
      quickly, suffice it to say that he came back that night, at which the
      company&mdash;that is to say the two lovers&mdash;was much alarmed, and so
      taken by surprise, (for they did not expect this inopportune return) that
      the poor gentleman could think of nothing else to do than to hide in the
      privy which was close to the chamber, hoping to escape by some means that
      his mistress would find before the knight came into the chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced that our knight, who that day had ridden sixteen or eighteen
      long leagues, was so tired and stiff that he would sup in his chamber,
      where he had his boots taken off, and would not go to the dining-hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may guess that the poor gentleman paid dear for the pleasure he had
      had that day, for he was half dead with hunger, cold, and fear; and, to
      aggravate his misfortune, he was taken with such a horrible cough that it
      was wonderful that it was not heard in the chamber, where were assembled,
      the knight, the lady, and the other knights of the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, whose eyes and ears were open for any sign of her lover, heard
      him by chance, and her heart sank within her, for she feared that her
      husband would hear also. Soon after supper she found an opportunity to go
      to the privy, and told her lover to take care, for God's sake, and not
      cough like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, my dear," he said, "I cannot help it. God knows how I am punished.
      And for God's sake think of some way of getting me out of this."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will," she said, and with that she went away, and the good squire began
      his song over again, so loud indeed that he was much afraid he would be
      heard in the chamber; and might have been had not the lady talked very
      loudly in order to drown the noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the squire had this fresh attack of coughing, he knew of nothing
      better to do to prevent being heard than to stuff his head down the hole
      of the privy, where he was well "incensed", God knows, by the stuff
      therein, but he preferred that to being heard. In short, he was there a
      long time, with his head down the hole, spitting, sniffing, and coughing
      so much that it seemed as though he would never do anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this fit finished, the cough left him, and then he tried to draw out
      his head, but it was not in his power, so far had he pushed his shoulders
      through, and you may fancy that he was not very comfortable. In short he
      could not find means to get out, try as he would. He scraped his neck, and
      nearly pulled his ears off, and in the end, by God's will, he pulled so
      hard that he tore away the seat of the privy, which hung round his neck.
      It was beyond his power to get out of it, but troublesome as it was, he
      preferred that to his previous position:
    </p>
    <p>
      His mistress came and found him in that state, and was much astonished.
      She could not help him, and all the consolation she could give him was to
      tell him that she could find no means of getting him out of the house.

    <p>
      "Is that so?" he said. "Morbleu! I am well armed to fight any one, but I
      must have a sword in my hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was soon provided with a good one, and the lady, seeing his
      extraordinary appearance, although her heart was lull of doubt and
      uncertainty, could not refrain from laughing, and the squire also.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now I commend myself to God," he said. "I am going to try if I can get
      out of the house; but first black my face well."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did so, and recommended him to God, and the poor fellow, with the seat
      of the privy round his neck, a drawn sword in his hand, and his face
      blacker than charcoal, sallied out into the room, and by luck the first
      person he met was the husband, who was in such mortal fear at the sight of
      him&mdash;believing it was the Devil himself&mdash;that he tumbled full
      length on the floor and nearly broke his neck, and was for a long time in
      a swoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife, seeing him in this condition, came forward, and pretending to
      show much more fear than she really felt, supported him in her arms, and
      asked him what was the matter. As soon as he came to himself, he said in
      broken accents, and with a piteous air; "Did you see that devil I met."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I did," she replied, "and I nearly died of fright at the sight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why does it come to our house?" he asked, "And who could have sent it? I
      shall not recover myself for a year or two, I have been so frightened."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor shall I, by God," said the pious lady. "I believe it must mean
      something. May God keep us, and protect us from all evil fortune. My heart
      forebodes some mischief from this vision."
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one in the castle gave his or her version of the devil with a drawn
      sword, and they all believed it was a real devil. The good lady, who held
      the key of the mystery, was very glad to see them of that opinion. Ever
      after that the said devil continued to do the work that everyone does so
      willingly, though the husband, and everybody except a discreet waiting
      woman, were ignorant of the fact.

    <h2>
      STORY THE SEVENTY-THIRD &mdash; THE BIRD IN THE CAGE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Jehan Lambin.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a curé who was in love with the wife of one of his parishioners,
        with whom the said curé was found by the husband of the woman, the
        neighbours having given him warning&mdash;and how the curé escaped, as
        you will hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the district of Saint Pol, in a village near that town, there formerly
      resided a worthy man, a labourer, married to a fair and buxom woman with
      whom the curé of the village was in love. He was burning with love for
      her, but he foresaw that his intentions might be suspected, and thought
      that the best way to win her would be to first gain the friendship of her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      He confided this opinion to the woman, and asked her advice, and she
      replied that it was a very good plan to enable them to carry out their
      amorous intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curé, by flattery and subtle means, made the acquaintance of the good
      man, and managed him so well that he was always talking of "his curé", and
      would not eat or do anything else without him. Every day he would have him
      to dinner and supper, in short there was nothing done at the good man's
      house without the curé being present. By this means he could come to the
      house as often as he pleased, and whatever time he liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the neighbours of this foolish labourer, seeing what he could not see,
      his eyes being bandaged by weakness and confidence,&mdash;told him that it
      was not right and proper to have the curé at his house every day, and
      that, if it continued, his wife's reputation would suffer, these frequent
      visits having been noticed and spoken about by his neighbours and friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the good man found himself thus sharply reproved by his neighbours
      for the frequent visits of the curé to his house, he was obliged to tell
      the curé that he must cease his constant calls, and forbade him by strict
      orders and menaces ever to come again until he was invited; affirming by a
      great oath that if ever he found the curé in his house there would be an
      account to settle between them, and it would not be pleasant for the
      visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      This prohibition displeased the curé more than I can tell you, but though
      vexed, he would not break off his love affair, for it was so deeply rooted
      in the hearts of both parties that it could not be easily eradicated. But
      hear how the curé managed after this prohibition. By an agreement with his
      mistress, he used to be informed of the times when her husband was absent,
      and then visit her. But he managed clumsily, for he could not pay his
      visits without the knowledge of the neighbours, who had been the cause of
      the interdict, and who were as much displeased at the cure's acts as
      though they had been personally concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man was again informed that the curé used to come and put out the
      fire at his house every night, (*) as he did before he was forbidden. The
      foolish husband, hearing that, was much astonished and also angry, and to
      remedy this state of affairs, thought of the means which I will relate.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) That is to say came at curfew time.
</pre>
    <p>
      He told his wife that he was going, on a certain day which he named, to
      take to St. Orner a waggon-load of corn, and that the work might be well
      done, was going himself. When the day named for his departure arrived, he
      did, as is usual in Picardy, especially round St. Omer, that is loaded his
      waggon of corn at midnight, and at that hour took leave of his wife and
      departed with his waggon.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he was gone, his wife closed all the doors of the house. Now
      you must know that the St. Omer to which our merchant was going was the
      house of one of his friends who lived at the other end of the village. He
      arrived there, put his waggon in the courtyard of the said friend&mdash;who
      knew all the business&mdash;and sent him to keep watch and listen round
      the house to see if any thief might come.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrived, he concealed himself at the corner of a thick hedge, from
      which spot he could see all the doors of the house of the merchant, of
      whom he was the friend and servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had he taken his place than there arrived the curé, who had come to
      light his candle&mdash;or rather to put it out&mdash;and softly and
      secretly knocked at the door, which was soon opened by one who was not
      inclined to sleep at that time, who came down in her chemise, and let in
      her confessor, and then closed the door and led him to the place where her
      husband ought to have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      The watcher, when he perceived what was done, left his post, and went and
      informed the husband. Upon which news, the following plan was quickly
      arranged between them. The corn-merchant pretended to have returned from
      his journey on account of certain adventures which had, or might have,
      happened to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knocked at the door, and shouted to his wife, who was much alarmed when
      she heard his voice, and made haste to conceal her lover, the curé, in a
      <i>casier</i> that was in the chamber; and you must know that a <i>casier</i>
      is a kind of pantry-cupboard, long and narrow and fairly deep, and very
      much like a trough.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the curé was concealed amongst the eggs, butter cheese, and
      other such victuals, the brave housewife, pretending to be half awake half
      asleep, let in her husband, and said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear husband, what can have happened that you have returned so
      quickly? There must be some reason why you did not go on your journey&mdash;for
      God's sake tell it me quickly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man, who was as angry as he could be, although he did not show
      it, insisted on going to their bedroom and there telling her the cause of
      his sudden return. When he was where he expected to find the curé, that is
      to say in the bedroom, he began to relate his reasons for breaking his
      journey. Firstly, he said he had such suspicion of her virtue that he
      feared much to be numbered amongst the blue vestments, (*) or "our
      friends" as they are commonly called, and that it was because of this
      suspicion that he had returned so quickly. Also that when he was out of
      the house it had occurred to his mind that the curé was his deputy whilst
      he was away. So to put his suspicions to the test, he had come back, and
      now wanted the candle to see whether his wife had been sleeping alone
      during his absence.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) In the present day, yellow is the emblematic colour for
     jealous or cuckolded husbands, but it would appear from this
     passage that in the 15th century it was blue-possibly,
     Bibliophile Jacob thinks, from its being the colour of the
     <i>maquereau</i>.
</pre>
    <p>
      When he had finished relating the causes of his return, the good woman
      cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear husband, whence comes this baseless jealousy? Have you ever
      seen in my conduct anything that should not be seen in that of a good,
      faithful, and virtuous wife? Cursed be the hour I first knew you, since
      you suspect me of that which my heart could never imagine. You know me
      badly if you do not know how clean and pure my heart is, and will remain."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man paid little heed to these words, but said that he wished to
      allay his suspicions, and to at once inspect every corner of the chamber
      as well as possible,&mdash;but he did not find what he sought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he caught sight of the <i>casier</i>, and he guessed that the man he
      wanted was inside, but he made no sign, and calling his wife said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I was wrong to presume that you were untrue to me, and such as
      my false suspicions imagined. Nevertheless, I am so obstinate in my
      opinions, that it would be impossible for me to live comfortably with you
      henceforth. And therefore I hope you will agree that a separation should
      be made between us, and that we divide our goods equally in a friendly
      manner."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wench, who was pleased with this arrangement, in order that she might
      more easily see her curé, agreed with scarcely any difficulty to her
      husband's request, but she made it a condition that in the division of the
      furniture she should have first choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why," said the husband, "should you have first choice? It is against
      all right and justice."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a long time squabbling about first choice, but in the end the
      husband won, and took the <i>casier</i> in which there was nothing but
      custards, tarts, cheeses, and other light provisions, amongst which was
      the good curé buried, and he heard all the discussion that went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the husband chose the <i>casier</i>, his wife chose the copper; then
      the husband chose another article then she chose; and so on until all the
      articles were apportioned out.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the division was made, the husband said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will allow you to live in my house until you have found another
      lodging, but I am going now to take my share of the furniture, and put it
      in the house of one of my neighbours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so," she said, "when you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took a good cord and tightly tied up the <i>casier</i>; then sent for
      his waggoner and told him to put the <i>casier</i> on a horse's back and
      take it to the house of a certain neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good woman heard these orders, but did not dare to interfere, for she
      feared that if she did it would not advance matters, but perhaps cause the
      <i>casier</i> to be opened, so she trusted to luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <i>casier</i> was placed on the horse, and taken through the streets
      to the house the good man had mentioned. But they had not gone far before
      the curé, who was choked and blinded with eggs and butter, cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      "For God's sake! mercy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The waggoner hearing this piteous appeal come out of the <i>casier</i>,
      jumped off the horse much frightened, and called the servants and his
      master, and they opened the <i>casier</i>, and found the poor prisoner all
      smeared and be-yellowed with eggs, cheese, milk, and more than a hundred
      other things, indeed it would have been hard to say which there was most
      of,&mdash;in such a pitiable condition was the poor lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the husband saw him in that state, he could not help laughing,
      although he felt angry; He let him go, and then went back to his wife to
      tell her that he had not been wrong in suspecting her of unchastity. She
      seeing herself fairly caught, begged for mercy, and was pardoned on this
      condition, that if ever the case occurred again, she should be better
      advised than to put her lover in the <i>casier</i>, for the curé had stood
      a good chance of being killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that they lived together for a long time, and the husband brought
      back his <i>casier</i>, but I do not think that the curé was ever found in
      it again, but ever after that adventure he was known, and still is, as
      "Sire Vadin Casier".

      STORY THE SEVENTY-FOURTH &mdash; THE OBSEQUIOUS PRIEST.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Philippe De Laon.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a priest of Boulogne who twice raised the body of Our Lord whilst
        chanting a Mass, because he believed that the Seneschal of Boulogne had
        come late to the Mass, and how he refused to take the Pax until the
        Seneschal had done so, as you will hear hereafter.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Once when the Seneschal of the County of Boulogne was travelling through
      the district visiting each town, he passed through a hamlet where the bell
      was ringing for Mass, and as he expected that he should not reach the town
      to which he was going in time to hear Mass, for the hour was then nearly
      noon, he thought that he would dismount at this hamlet to see God in
      passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left his horse at the door of the church, and took a seat near the
      altar, where high Mass was being celebrated, and placed himself so near
      the priest, that the latter could see his profile whilst he was
      celebrating the Mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he raised the cup, and other things that he should, he thought to
      himself that he had noticed the Seneschal behind him, and not knowing
      whether he had come early enough to see the elevation, but believing that
      he had come too late, the priest called his clerk, and made him light the
      candles, and, performing all the ceremonies that he should, he again
      raised the Host, saying that that was for Monseigneur le Seneschal.
    </p>
    <p>
      And after that he proceeded until he came to the <i>Agnus Dei</i> which,
      when he had said three times, and his clerk gave him the Pax to kiss, he
      refused, approaching his clerk and saying that he should first present it
      to the Seneschal, who refused it two or three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the priest saw that the Seneschal would not take the Pax before him,
      he put down the Host which he had in his hands, and took the Pax, which he
      carried to my lord the Seneschal, and told him that if my lord did not
      take it first, he would not take it himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For it is not right," said the priest, "that I should take the Pax before
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Seneschal, seeing that wisdom was not to be found in that place,
      gave in to the curé and took the Pax first, and the curé followed him; and
      that being done he returned to perform the rest of the Mass.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this is all that was related to me.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Thalemas.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a hare-brained half-mad fellow who ran a great risk of being put
        to death by being hanged on a gibbet in order to injure and annoy the
        Bailly, justices, and other notables of the city of Troyes in Champagne
        by whom he was mortally hated, as will appear more plainly hereafter.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the time of the war between the Burgundians; and the Armagnacs, (*)
      there happened at Troyes in Champagne, a rather curious incident which is
      well worth being recorded, and which was as follows. The people of Troyes,
      though they had been Burgundians, had joined the Armagnacs, and amongst
      them there had formerly lived a fellow who was half mad, for he had not
      entirely lost his senses, though his words and actions showed more folly
      than good sense&mdash;nevertheless he would sometimes say and do things
      which a wiser than he could not have bettered.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) The reign of Charles VI, after the assassination of the
     Duc d'Orléans by Jean-sans-Peur, was marked by along civil
     war between the factions here named, and who each in turn
     called in the aid of the English.
</pre>
    <p>
      To begin the story, however; this fellow who was in garrison with the
      Burgundians at Sainte Menehould, one day told his companions that if they
      would listen to him, he would teach them how to catch a batch of the
      yokels of Troyes, whom, in truth, he hated mortally, and they hardly loved
      him, for they had always threatened to hang him if they caught him. This
      is what he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will go to Troyes and will approach the fortifications, and will
      pretend to be spying round the town, and will measure the moat with my
      lance, and will get so near the town that I shall be taken prisoner. I am
      sure that as soon as the good <i>bailli</i> gets hold of me, he will
      condemn me to be hanged, and there is no one in the town who will take my
      part for they all hate me. So, early the next morning, I shall be taken
      out to the gibbet, (*) and you will all be hidden in the thicket which is
      near the gibbet. And as soon as you see me arrive with the procession, you
      will spring out upon them, and take whom you like, and deliver me out of
      their hands." All his companions in garrison with him agreed to this
      willingly, and told him that if he would dare this adventure, they would
      assist him to the best of their power.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) The gibbet was usually outside the town, often at some
     considerable distance from the walls.
</pre>
    <p>
      To shorten the story, the simpleton went to Troyes as he had said, and, as
      he desired, he was taken prisoner. The report soon spread through the
      town, and there was no one who did not say he ought to be hanged; even the
      Bailli, as soon as he saw him, swore by all his gods that he should be
      hanged by the neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! monseigneur," said the poor fool, "I pray for mercy. I have done
      nothing wrong."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lie, scoundrel," said the Bailly. "You have guided the Burgundians
      into this district, and you have accused the citizens and merchants of
      this city. You shall have your reward, for you shall be hanged on a
      gibbet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For God's sake then, monseigneur," said the poor fellow; "since I must
      die, at least let it please you that it be in the early morning; so that,
      as I have many acquaintances in the town, I may not be held up to public
      opprobrium."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said the Bailly, "I will think about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning at day-break, the hangman with his cart came to the
      prison, and hardly had he arrived than there came the Bailly with his
      sergeants, and a great crowd of people to accompany them, and the poor
      fellow was laid, bound, on the cart, and still holding the bagpipe he was
      accustomed to play. Thus he was led to the gibbet, accompanied by a larger
      crowd than most have at their hanging, so much was he hated in the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you must know that his comrades of the garrison of Sainte Menehould
      had not forgotten their ambuscade, and ever since midnight had been
      collected near the gibbet, to save their friend, although he was not
      overwise, and also to capture prisoners and whatever else they could. When
      they arrived they took up their position, and put a sentinel in a tree to
      watch when the Troyes folk should be gathered round the gibbet. The
      sentinel was placed in his position, and promised that he would keep a
      good watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then all the crowd came to the gibbet, and the Bailli gave order to
      despatch the poor fool, who for his part wondered where his comrades were,
      and why they did not rush out on these rascally Armagnacs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not feel at all comfortable, and he looked all round, but chiefly
      towards the wood, but he heard nothing. He made his confession last as
      long as he could, but at last the priest went away, and the poor fellow
      had to mount the ladder, and from this elevated position, God knows that
      he looked often towards the wood; but it was of no avail, for the
      sentinel, who was to give the signal when the men were to rush out, had
      gone to sleep in the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor fellow did not know what to say or do, and verily believed that
      his last hour had come. The hangman began to make preparations to put the
      noose round the victim's neck, who, when he saw that, bethought him of a
      trick, which turned out well for him, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur le Bailli, I beg you for God's sake, that before the hangman
      lays hands on me, I may be allowed to play a tune on my bagpipe. That is
      all I ask; after that I shall be ready to die, and I pardon you and all
      the others for having caused my death."
    </p>
    <p>
      His request was granted, and the bagpipe was handed up to him. As soon as
      he had it, he began, as leisurely as he could, to play an air which all
      his comrades knew very well, and which was called. "You stay too long,
      Robin; you stay too long."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of the bagpipe the sentinel woke, and was so startled that he
      tumbled out of the tree to the ground, and cried,
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are hanging our comrade! Forward! Forward! make haste!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His comrades were ready, and at the sound of the trumpet they sallied out
      of the wood, and rushed upon the Bailly and all the others who were round
      the gibbet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hangman was too frightened to put the rope round the man's neck and
      push him off the ladder, but begged for his own life, which the other
      would willingly have granted but it was not in his power. The victim,
      however, did something better, for from his place on the ladder he called
      out to his comrades, "Capture that man, he is rich; and that one, he is
      dangerous."
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the Burgundians killed a great number of those who had come out
      of Troyes, and captured many others, and saved their man, as you have
      heard, but he said that never in all his life had he had such a narrow
      escape as on that occasion.

    <h3>
      By Philippe De Laon.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of the chaplain to a knight of Burgundy who was enamoured of the
        wench of the said knight, and of the adventure which happened on account
        of his amour, as you will hear below.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I have often heard related, by people worthy of credit, a curious history,
      which will furnish me a tale without my adding or suppressing one word
      that is not needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the knights of Burgundy was formerly one, who, contrary to the
      custom of the country, kept in his castle&mdash;which I will not name&mdash;a
      fair wench to serve as his mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      His chaplain, who was young and frisky, seeing this nice wench, was not so
      virtuous but that he felt tempted, and fell in love with her, and when he
      saw his opportunity, told her of his love. The damsel, who was as sharp as
      mustard, for she had knocked about so much that no one in the world knew
      more than she did, thought to herself that if she granted the priest's
      request her master would hear of it, however much she tried to conceal it,
      and thus she would lose the greater for the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she determined to relate the affair to her master, who when he heard of
      it did nothing but laugh, for he had partly suspected it, having noticed
      the looks, conversation and little love-tricks that passed between the
      two. Nevertheless, he ordered the wench to lead the priest on, without,
      however, granting him her favours; and she did it so well that the priest
      fell into the trap. The knight used often to say him;
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, sir, you are too friendly with my chamber-wench. I do not know
      what there is between you two, but if it is anything to my prejudice, by
      Our Lady, I will punish the two of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In truth, monseigneur," replied the Dominie. "I do not pretend to expect
      anything from her. I talk to her to pass the time, as everyone else in the
      house does, but never in my life would I seek her love, or anything of the
      kind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said the lord, "if it were otherwise I should not be best
      pleased."
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Dominie had importuned her before, he now pursued her more than
      ever, and wherever he met the wench he pressed her so closely that she was
      obliged, whether she would or not, to listen to his requests, and, being
      cunning and deceitful, she so played with the priest and encouraged his
      love, that for her sake he would have fought Ogier the Dane himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she had left him, the whole conversation that had passed
      between them was related to her master.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make the farce more amusing, and to deceive his chaplain, he ordered
      the girl to appoint a night for him to be in the <i>ruelle</i> of the bed
      where they slept. She was to say to him. "As soon as monseigneur is
      asleep, I will do what you want; come quietly into the <i>ruelle</i> of
      the bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you must," he said, "let him do what he likes, and so will I; and I
      am sure that when he believes I am asleep, that he will soon have his arms
      round you, and I will have ready, near your &mdash;&mdash;, a noose in
      which he will be nicely caught."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wench was very joyful and satisfied with this arrangement, and gave
      the message to the Dominie, who never in his life had been more delighted,
      and, without thinking of or imagining peril or danger, entered his
      master's chamber, where the wench and his master slept. He cast all sense
      and decency to the winds, and only thought of satisfying his foolish lust,&mdash;albeit
      it was quite natural.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cut the story short, Master Priest came at the hour appointed, and
      crept quietly enough, God knows, into the <i>ruelle</i> of the bed, and
      his mistress whispered to him;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't say a word: when monsieur is fast asleep I will touch you, and then
      come to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very good," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good knight, who was not asleep, had a great inclination to laugh, but
      checked himself, in order not to spoil the joke. As he had proposed and
      arranged, he spread his noose where he wished, that is to say round the
      spot where the priest wanted to get.
    </p>
    <p>
      All being ready, the Dominie was called, and as gently as he could,
      slipped into the bed, and without more ado, mounted on the heap in order
      to see the further. (*)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) A proverbial expression founded perhaps on some old
     story which may be alluded to also in the 12th and 82nd
     stories.
</pre>
    <p>
      As soon as he was lodged there, the good knight drew the cord tightly, and
      said aloud,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha! scoundrelly priest, is that the sort of man you are?" The priest
      tried to run away, but he could not go far, for the instrument he had
      tried to tune to the girl's fiddle was caught in the noose, at which he
      was much frightened, and did not know what had happened to him. His master
      pulled the cord more tightly, which would have given him great pain if his
      fear and alarm had not conquered all other sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments he came to himself, and felt the pain and cried piteously
      for mercy to his master, who had such a strong desire to laugh that he
      could scarcely speak. He pulled the priest into the room and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get out, and never come here again! I pardon you in this occasion, but
      the second time I shall be inexorable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, monsieur," he replied, "I will never do it again. It is all her
      fault," and with that he ran away and the knight went to bed again, and
      finished what the other had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      But you must know that never again was the priest found trespassing on his
      master's preserves. Perhaps, as a recompense for his misfortunes the girl
      afterwards took pity on him, and to ease her conscience lent him her
      fiddle, and he tuned it so well that the master suffered both in goods and
      honour. But now I will say no more, and end my story.

        <i>Of a gentleman of Flanders, who went to reside in France, but whilst
        he was there his mother was very ill in Flanders; and how he often went
        to visit her believing that she would die, and what he said and how he
        behaved, as you will hear later.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A gentleman of Flanders had a mother who was very old and much weakened by
      disease, and more sick and infirm than any woman of her age. Hoping that
      she would get better, and be cured, he often came to see her, although he
      resided in France, and each time that he came he found her suffering so
      much that he thought her soul was about to leave her body.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one occasion that he came to see her, she said to him at his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Adieu, my son; I am sure that you will never see me again for I am about
      to die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Devil take it, mother, you have said that so often that I am sick of it.
      For three years past you have been repeating that, but you have done
      nothing of the kind. Choose a day, I beg, and keep to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good woman, when she heard her son's reply, smiled, though she was so
      sick and old, and said farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      One year, then two years, passed, and still she lingered on. She was again
      visited by her son, and one night when he was in bed in her house, and she
      was so ill that all believed she was about to go to Mortaigne, (*) those
      who watched her called her son, and told him to come to his mother
      quickly, for that certainly she was about to die.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) Mild puns on the names of places were very common in the
     Middle Ages.
</pre>
    <p>
      "Do you say that she is about to die?" he replied. "By my soul, I will not
      believe it; she always says that, but she never does it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no," said the nurses; "this time it is certain. Come quickly for it
      is sure that she is dying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well, you go first and I will follow you; and tell my mother that if
      she must go, not to go by Douai, for the road is so bad that I and my
      horses were nearly swallowed up yesterday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless he rose, and put on his dressing-gown, and went off to see
      his mother give her last grin. When he came he found her very ill, for she
      had been in a swoon which all thought would carry her off, but, thank God,
      she was now a little better.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I not tell you so?" said this good son. "Every body in this house
      declares, and she does herself, that she is dying&mdash;but nothing comes
      of it. For God's sake choose a day&mdash;as I have often told you&mdash;and
      see that you keep to it! I am going to return whence I came, and I
      recommend you not to call me again. If she does die she must die alone,
      for I will not keep her company."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I must tell you the end of this history. The lady, ill as she was,
      recovered from this extreme sickness, and lived and languished as before
      for the space of three years, during which time her good son visited her
      once, and that was just as she was about to give up the ghost. But when
      they came to seek him to come to her deathbed, he was trying on a new
      habit and would not come. Message after message was sent to him, for his
      good mother, who was nearing her end, wished to recommend her soul to her
      son's care,&mdash;but to all the messages he replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am sure there is no hurry: she will wait till my habit is finished."
    </p>
    <p>
      At last so many remonstrances were made to him that he went to his mother,
      wearing a doublet with no sleeves to it, which, when she saw, she asked
      him where were the sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are within there,&mdash;waiting to be finished as soon as you clear
      out of the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then they will be soon finished," she replied; "for I go to God, to whom
      I humbly recommend my soul; and to you also, my son."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without another word she rendered her soul to God, with the Cross between
      her arms; on seeing which her good son began to weep so loudly that no one
      had ever heard the like; he could not be comforted, and at the end of a
      fortnight he died of grief.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Jehan Martin.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a married gentleman who made many long voyages, during which time
        his good and virtuous wife made the acquaintance of three good fellows,
        as you will hear; and how she confessed her amours to her husband when
        he returned from his travels, thinking she was confessing to the curé,
        and how she excused herself, as will appear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The province of Brabant is a fair and pleasant land, well provided with
      pretty girls, who are generally clever and good; but as for the men, it is
      said of them, with a good deal of truth, that the longer they live the
      greater fools they become.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was formerly a gentleman of this land who&mdash;being thereunto born
      and destined&mdash;travelled much beyond seas to various places, as
      Cyprus, Rhodes, and the adjacent parts, and at last came to Jerusalem,
      where he received the order of knighthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the time that he was away, his good wife was not idle, but took her
      <i>quoniam</i> with three lovers, who like courtiers, each had audience in
      turn and for a certain time.
    </p>
    <p>
      First came a gentle squire, fresh and frisky, and in good health, who
      spent so much upon her, physically and pecuniarily (for in truth she
      plucked him well) that at last he was sick of it, and left her altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      The one who came after him was a knight, and a man of a great reputation,
      who was very glad to have acquired the succession, and worked her as well
      as he could, paying his <i>quibus</i> (*), which no one knew better than
      this lusty wench how to get out of a man. In short, if the squire, who had
      previously held the position, had been plucked, the knight was not less
      so, until at last he turned tail, took leave of her, and left the place
      open to the next comer.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) Property or wealth; the expression is still used in
     familiar conversation.
</pre>
    <p>
      As a tit-bit to finish with, the damsel made the acquaintance of a rich
      priest, and although he was cunning enough, and not over liberal with
      money, he was despoiled of rich gowns, vessels, and other valuables.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened, thank God, that the husband of the wench let her know
      that he was coming home; and how he had been made a knight at Jerusalem.
      His good wife had the house cleaned and prepared as well as possible.
      Everything was ready for his return, except the lady, and she was somewhat
      disturbed on account of the vast quantity of booty&mdash;tapestry,
      furniture, vessels, and other valuables&mdash;which she had gained upon
      her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her husband arrived, God knows what a joyful reception he had,
      especially from the one who cared least about him, that is to say his
      worthy wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pass over all the welcomings, but her husband, although he was a fool,
      could not help quickly noticing the heap of furniture, which was not there
      at his departure. He went to the coffers, the buffets, and a number of
      other places, and everywhere he found his store increased, and the sight
      of all this booty filled his mind with evil thoughts, and in a hot temper
      he called for his wife, and demanded to know whence had come all these
      goods I have already-named.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John," said the lady, "that is a nice question. You have good
      reason to go on like this and get so warm. To look at you one would think
      you were cross."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not in the best of tempers," he replied; "for I did not leave you so
      much money that you could have saved enough to buy all these utensils,
      hangings, and the other things that I find here. I suspect, with good
      reason, that our household has been increased by some friend of yours
      during my absence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God!" replied the lady, "you are wrong to suspect me of such
      misconduct. I would have you to know that I am not a woman of that kind,
      but a better wife in every respect than you deserve; and it is not right
      that after all the trouble I have taken to save and economise to embellish
      and adorn your house and mine, that I should be reproved and scolded. That
      is not at all the sort of reward that a good husband should give to a
      chaste wife such as you have, you wicked wretch. It is a great pity I have
      not been unfaithful to you, and I would be if I did not value my honour
      and my soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      This quarrel, though it lasted a long while, ceased for a time, for the
      husband thought of a plan how to find out the truth about his wife. He
      arranged with the curé, who was a great friend of his, that he should hear
      her confession, and this he did with the help of the curé, who managed the
      whole affair, for one morning in Easter week, the curé made the husband
      put on the priest's robe, and then sent word to the lady to come and
      confess.
    </p>
    <p>
      It need not be asked if the husband was glad when he found himself thus
      disguised. He went to the chapel, and entered the confessional without
      saying a word; his wife approached and knelt at his feet, really believing
      she was confessing to the curé, and said <i>Benedicite</i>. To this her
      husband replied <i>Dominus</i>, as the curé had taught him, and whatever
      else was necessary, as well as he could manage it.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the good woman had made a general confession, she descended to
      particulars, and told how, during the time that her husband had been away,
      a squire had been his deputy, and from him she had acquired much property,
      in gold, in silver, and in furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      God knows that the husband, when he heard this confession did not feel
      very comfortable; he would willingly have killed her on the spot if he had
      dared, nevertheless he was patient in order that he might hear the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had said all there was to say about the squire, she accused
      herself of misconduct with the knight, who, like his predecessor, had paid
      her well. The good husband, nearly bursting with grief, had a good mind to
      discover himself and give her absolution without more ado, but he did
      nothing of the kind, and waited to hear what more she would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the knight came the turn of the priest, and at this the good husband
      lost patience and would hear no more; he threw aside hood and gown, and,
      showing himself said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "False and perfidious woman! now I see and know your treason! And would
      not a squire and a knight suffice you, but you must give yourself up to a
      priest? This vexes me more than all the other sins you have committed."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment this brave dame was taken aback, but soon recovered her
      confidence, and with a face as calm as though she had been the most just
      and virtuous woman in the world, saying her prayers to God, she replied as
      calmly as though the Holy Spirit had inspired her,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor fool! why do you thus worry yourself, you know not wherefore? Listen
      to me, if you please; and be assured that I knew perfectly well that I was
      confessing to you. I served you as you deserved, and without one word of
      falsehood confessed to you the real circumstances. These are the facts:
      you are the squire who slept with me, for when I married you, you were a
      squire, and did with me as you wished; you are the knight of whom I spoke,
      for on your return you made me a lady; and you are the priest also, for no
      one who is not a priest can hear a confession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my oath, my dear," he replied, "you have convinced me, and proved to
      me that you are a virtuous woman and that I was wrong to accuse you. I
      repent, and ask your pardon, and promise never to suspect you again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I willingly pardon you," said his wife, "since you confess your fault."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, as you have heard, was the good knight deceived by the ready wit of
      his wife.

    <h3>

    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a good man of Bourbonnais who went to seek the advice of a wise
        man of that place about an ass that he had lost, and how he believed
        that he miraculously recovered the said ass, as you will hear hereafter.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the fair land of Bourbonnais, where many good professions are carried
      on, there lived, not long ago, a doctor of God knows what sort, for never
      Hippocrates or Galen practised the science as he did. For instead of
      syrups, decoctions, electuaries, and the hundred thousand other things
      that physicians order to preserve the health of man, or restore it if it
      is lost, this good doctor of whom I am speaking had only one method of
      procedure, and that was to order clysters. Whatever matter was brought to
      him, (*) he always exhibited clysters, and generally so well did this
      remedy turn out that everyone was satisfied with him, and he cured them
      all, so that his fame spread abroad and increased in such a manner that he
      was called "Master" Jehan (**) by all, both in the houses of princes and
      lords, and in the great abbeys, and in the towns, and never was Aristotle
      or Galen so honoured, especially by the common people, as was our said
      Master. And his fame so increased that his advice was asked on every
      subject, and he was so incessantly in demand that he did not know what to
      do. If a woman had a bad, or whimsical, or capricious husband, she went to
      this good master for a remedy. In short, if any could give good advice it
      was thought that our physician was at the top of the tree in that respect,
      and people came to him from all parts to enquire about lost property.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) It was usual to bring the urine of an invalid to the
     physician.

     (**) "Master" was then a title of honour.
</pre>
    <p>
      It happened one day that a poor foolish countryman had lost his ass, and
      after seeking for it a long time, he determined to go to the wise man, who
      when he arrived was so surrounded by people that the countryman could not
      make himself heard. At last he broke through the crowd, and, in the
      presence of many persons, related his case, that is to say that he had
      lost his ass, and asked the doctor to get it back for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master, who was listening to others more than to him, just heard the
      sound of the words, and thinking he had some infirmity, turned towards
      him, and in order to get rid of him, said to his servants,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give him a clyster!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor man who had lost his ass, did not know what the master had said,
      but he was seized by the physician's servants, who led him away and gave
      him a clyster&mdash;at which he was much astonished, for he did not know
      what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had this clyster in his belly, he went away, without saying
      anything more about his ass, which he fully believed he should recover.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not gone far when his belly was so tossed about that he was forced
      to turn aside into a deserted hut, because of the clyster which demanded
      to be let out. And when he began, he made such a terrible noise, that his
      ass, which chanced to be straying near, began to bray, and the good man
      rose up and cried, <i>Te Deum laudamus</i>, and went to his ass, which he
      believed he had found by means of the clyster which he had had from the
      Master, who after that had incomparably more renown than ever; for he was
      looked-upon as the sure finder of all lost goods, and the perfect master
      of all science, and all this fame sprang from a single clyster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus have you heard how the ass was found by means of a clyster; it is a
      manifest fact, and one that often happens.

      STORY THE EIGHTIETH &mdash; GOOD MEASURE! <a href="#linklinknote-80"
      name="linklinknoteref-80" id="linklinknoteref-80">80</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Michault De Changy.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a young German girl, aged fifteen or sixteen or thereabouts who
        was married to a gentle gallant, and who complained that her husband had
        too small an organ for her liking, because she had seen a young ass of
        only six months old which had a bigger instrument than her husband, who
        was 24 or 26 years old.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      I have heard it related as true by two noble lords worthy of faith and
      belief, that in the borders of Germany there lived a young girl, who at
      the age of about 15 or 16 years was married to a worthy gentleman, who did
      his best to satisfy the demands which, without saying a word, all girls of
      that age and condition earnestly ask for. But though the poor man did his
      duty well, and indeed more often than he should, the performance was never
      agreeable to his wife, who was always sulky, and often wept as sadly as
      though all her friends were dead. Her good husband, seeing her thus
      lament, could not imagine what she could want, and asked her tenderly;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter, my dear? Are you not as well clothed, lodged, and
      served, as people in our position of life can reasonably expect to be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not that which vexes me," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what can it be?" he asked. "Tell me, and if I can remedy it, I will,
      at whatever cost to my purse or person."
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, she did not reply, but still sulked, and looked miserable, at
      which her husband lost his patience, finding she would not tell him the
      cause of her grief. But he enquired so often that at last he learned
      partly what was the matter, for she told him that she was vexed because he
      was so poorly furnished with you-know-what&mdash;that is to say the stick
      with which you plant men, as Boccaccio calls it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed!" said he, "and is that why you grieve? By St. Martin you have
      good cause! At any rate it cannot be other than it is, and you must put up
      with it, since you cannot change it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This condition of affairs lasted a long time, till the husband, tired of
      her obstinacy, one day invited to dinner a great number of her friends,
      and stated the facts which have been already related, and said that it
      seemed to him that she had no particular cause to grieve, for he believed
      he was as well furnished with a natural instrument as any of his
      neighbours.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that I may be the better believed," he said, "and that you may see
      how wrong she is, I will show it you all."
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he laid his furniture on the table before all the men and women
      there assembled, and said; "There it is!" and his wife wept louder than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John!" said her mother, her sister, her aunt, her cousin, and her
      neighbour, "you are wrong, my dear! What do you ask? Do you expect more?
      Who would not be satisfied with a husband so furnished? So help me God I
      should deem myself very happy to have as much, or indeed less. Be
      comforted and enjoy yourself in future! By God, you are better off than
      any of us I believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      The young bride, hearing all the women thus speak, replied, still weeping
      loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is a little ass in the house, hardly half a year old, and who has
      an instrument as big, as thick, and as long as your arm,"&mdash;and so
      saying she held her arm by the elbow and shook it up and down&mdash;"and
      my husband, who is quite 24 years old has but that little bit he has shown
      you. Do you think I ought to be satisfied?" Everyone began to laugh, and
      she to weep the more, so that for a long time not a word was said by any
      of the company. Then her mother took the girl aside, and said one thing
      and another to her, and left her satisfied after a great deal of trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is the way with the girls in Germany&mdash;if God pleases it will
      soon be the same also in France.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Waurin.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a noble knight who was in love with a beautiful young married
        lady, and thought himself in her good graces, and also in those of
        another lady, her neighbour; but lost both as is afterwards recorded.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      As all the stories of asses are now finished, I will relate shortly a true
      story of a knight whom many of you noble lords have long known. It is true
      that this knight was greatly in love&mdash;as is often the way with young
      men&mdash;with a beautiful and noble young lady, who, in that part of the
      country where she lived was renowned for her beauty. Nevertheless, try
      what means he could to obtain her favours, and become her accepted lover,
      he could not succeed&mdash;at which he was much displeased, seeing that
      never was woman loved more ardently, loyally, and wholly than she was. Nor
      should I omit to say that he did as much for her as ever lover did for his
      lady, such as jousts, expensive habiliments, etc.&mdash;nevertheless, as
      has been said, he found her always brusque and averse, and showing him
      less love than she reasonably should, for she knew for a fact that she was
      loyally and dearly loved by him. And, to say truth, she was too harsh to
      him, which, it is to be believed, proceeded from pride, of which she had
      too much&mdash;it might even be said, with which she was filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters were in this condition, when another lady, a friend and neighbour
      of the first-named damsel, seeing how enamoured the knight was, fell in
      love with him herself, and by various honest ways and means which would
      take too long to describe, so subtly managed that in a short time the
      knight perceived her love, at which he was much vexed, his heart being
      wholly given to his harsh and cruel mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being not only kind, but possessed of much common sense he managed
      adroitly not to compromise himself, so that if his second love affair had
      come to the knowledge of his first mistress, she would have no cause to
      blame his conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now listen to the end of his amours. Owing to the distance at which he
      lived, he could not so often see his lady-love as his trusting and loving
      heart desired. So he determined one day to ask certain knights and
      squires, good friends of his, but who knew nothing about his love affairs,
      to fly their hawks, and hunt the hare in the district in which the lady
      resided, knowing for a fact by his spies, that her husband was away,
      having gone to Court, as he often did.
    </p>
    <p>
      As had been arranged, the love-sick knight and his companions started the
      next day, early in the morning, from the town where the Court was, and
      passed the time until the late afternoon in hunting the hare, and without
      eating or drinking. They snatched a hasty repast in a little village, and
      after the dinner, which was short and simple, remounted their horses and
      continued to hunt the hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good knight, who had only one object in view, led his companions from
      the city, to which they always wished to return and said to him, "The hour
      of vespers is near and it is time to return to the town. If we do not take
      care we shall be locked out, and have to stay the night in some miserable
      village and all die of hunger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be alarmed," said the lover; "there is plenty of time, and at the
      worst I know a place near here where we shall be very welcome, and I
      suppose you will have no objection to meeting ladies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Being all courtiers, thy were not at all disinclined to meet ladies, and
      were satisfied to leave the matter in his hands, and continued to hunt the
      hare and the partridge as long as daylight lasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was time to think of finding lodgings, the knight said to his
      companions,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come along, come along! I will lead you to the place." About an hour or
      two after nightfall, the knight and his comrades arrived at the place
      where lived the lady with whom the guide of this little band was so
      enamoured that he could not sleep o'nights. They knocked at the door of
      the castle, and the varlets quickly came and asked them what they wanted.
      And he who was the most deeply concerned, answered and said; "Gentlemen,
      are my lord and my lady at home?" "Truly," replied one of the attendants
      for all the others, "my lord is not here, but my lady is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell her if you please, that such and such knights and squires of the
      Court, and I, so-and-so, have been hunting the hare in this part of the
      country, and have lost our way, and now it is too late to return to the
      town. We beg her therefore to receive us as her guests for this night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Willingly will I tell her," said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went and delivered this message to his mistress, who, instead of coming
      to the gentlemen, sent a message, which the servant thus delivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur," said the varlet, "my lady wishes me to inform you that her
      husband is not here; at which she is much vexed, for if he had been he
      would have given you a hearty welcome; but in his absence she does not
      dare to receive visitors, and begs you therefore to pardon her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight, who had led the expedition, was, you may imagine, much vexed
      and ashamed to hear this reply, for he expected to have seen his mistress,
      and had a pleasant time with her, and emptied his heart to her, and he was
      annoyed that he had brought his companions to a place where he had boasted
      they would be well received.
    </p>
    <p>
      Like a wise and noble knight, he did not show what he felt in his heart,
      but with a calm countenance said to his comrades,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen, pardon me that I have lured you with false hopes. I did not
      believe that the ladies of this part of the country were so wanting in
      courtesy as to refuse a lodging to wandering knights. But have a little
      patience. I promise you on my word, to take you somewhere&mdash;not far
      from here&mdash;where we shall have quite a different welcome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forward then!" said all the others. "May God give us good luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      They set off, under the direction of their guide, to take them to the
      house of the lady by whom he was esteemed, though he did not return her
      affection as he ought to have done; but now he determined to devote to her
      the love which had been so roughly refused by his first mistress, and he
      determined to love, serve, and obey her who loved him so, and with whom,
      please God, he would soon be.
    </p>
    <p>
      To shorten the story, after riding for a good hour and a half with the
      drenching rain on their backs, they came to the house of the lady who has
      previously being mentioned, and gaily knocked at the door, for it was very
      late,&mdash;between nine and ten o'clock at night, and they much feared
      that all the household would be in bed. Varlets and servant maids at once
      came forth, and asked, "Who is there?" and they were told.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went at once to their mistress, who was then in her petticoat, and
      had put on her nightcap, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame, my lord so-and-so is at the gate and would fain enter; and with
      him certain knights and squires of the Court to the number of three."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are very welcome," she said. "Up quickly, all of you! Kill some
      capons and fowls, and let us have a good supper, and quickly."
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, she gave her orders like the great lady that she was&mdash;and
      still is,&mdash;and all obeyed her commands. She quickly put on her
      night-dress, and thus attired, came forward, as courteously as possible,
      to meet the gentlemen, with two torches carried before her, and only
      accompanied by one waiting woman, and her beautiful daughter&mdash;all the
      other women being employed in preparing the chambers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She met her guests upon the drawbridge of the castle, and the noble knight
      who was the guide and spokesman of the others, came forward and expressed
      his gratitude for her kindness, and kissed her, and all the others did the
      same after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then like a courteous woman of the world, she said to the lords,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlemen, you are very welcome. Monseigneur So-and-so (that is to say
      their guide) I have known a long time. He is very welcome here, and I
      should be glad to make the acquaintance of you other gentlemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      These introductions were made, the supper was soon ready, and each of the
      gentlemen lodged in a fair and fine chamber, well appointed and furnished
      with hangings and everything necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be mentioned also, that whilst supper was preparing, the lady
      and the good knight had a long talk together, and arranged that they would
      only require one bed between them that night; her husband by good luck not
      being in the house, but forty leagues away.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will leave them enjoying their supper after the adventures of the day,
      and return to the lady who refused to receive the little band, even the
      man whom she knew loved her better than anyone else in the world, and had
      shown herself so discourteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked her servants, when they returned from delivering her message,
      what the knight had said?
    </p>
    <p>
      One of them replied: "Madame he said very little; only that he would take
      his friends to a place where they would have a hearty welcome and good
      cheer."
    </p>
    <p>
      She quickly guessed where they had gone, and said to herself, "Ah, he has
      gone to the house of such an one, who, I know, will not be sorry to see
      him, and no doubt they are now plotting against me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst she was thinking thus, the harshness and un-kindness which she had
      felt towards her faithful lover, melted away or was transformed into
      hearty affection and good-will, and she longed to bestow upon her lover
      whatever he might ask or require. So she at once set to work and
      suspecting that the lady to whom they had gone was now enjoying the
      society of the man she had treated so rudely, she penned a letter to her
      lover, most of the lines of which were written in her most precious blood,
      to the effect that as soon as he saw this letter, he should set all other
      matters aside, and follow the bearer of the missive, and he would be so
      kindly received that no lover in the world could expect more from his
      mistress. And as a token of her truth, she placed inside the letter a
      diamond ring he well knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bearer of this missive, who was a trustworthy man, went to the castle
      where the knight was sitting at supper next to the hostess, and with all
      the guests seated round the table. As soon as grace had been said, the
      messenger drew the knight aside and handed him the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having perused it, the good knight was much amazed, and still more joyous,
      for though he had determined in his own mind no longer to seek the love or
      acquaintance of the writer of the letter, he still felt tempted when the
      letter promised him that which he most desired in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He took his hostess aside, and told her that his master had sent an urgent
      message, and that he must leave at once&mdash;at which he pretended to
      feel much vexed,&mdash;and she, who had before been so joyful in the
      expectation of that she so much desired, became sad and sorrowful.
    </p>
    <p>
      He quietly mounted his horse, and leaving all his comrades behind, arrived
      with the messenger, soon after midnight, at the castle of the lady, but
      her husband had just arrived from Court and was then preparing to go to
      bed, and she, who had sent specially to fetch her lover, was disappointed
      enough, God knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good knight, who had been all day in the saddle, either hunting the
      hare or seeking for lodgings, heard at the door that the lady's husband
      had arrived, and you may guess how joyful he was at the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      He asked his guide what was to be done? They consulted together, and it
      was decided that he should pretend to have lost his companions, and, by
      good chance, met this messenger, who had brought him to the castle. This
      being arranged, he was brought before my lord and my lady, and acted his
      part as he well knew how. After having quaffed a cup of wine&mdash;which
      did him very little good&mdash;he was led to his bed-chamber, where he
      scarcely slept all night, and, early the next morning, returned with his
      host to Court, without having tasted any of the delights which were
      promised him in the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I may add that he was never able to return there again, for soon
      afterwards the Court left that part of the country, and he went with it,
      and soon forgot all about the lady&mdash;as often happens.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Lannoy.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a shepherd who made an agreement with a shepherdess that he should
        mount upon her "in order that he might see farther," but was not to
        penetrate beyond a mark which she herself made with her hand upon the
        instrument of the said shepherd&mdash;as will more plainly appear
        hereafter.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Listen, if you please, to what happened, near Lille, to a shepherd and
      young shepherdess who tended their flocks together, or near each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature had already stirred in them, and they were of an age to know "the
      way of the world", so one day an agreement was made between them that the
      shepherd should mount on the shepherdess "in order to see farther",&mdash;provided,
      however, that he should not penetrate beyond a mark which she made with
      her hand upon the natural instrument of the shepherd, and which was about
      two fingers' breadth below the head; and the mark was made with a
      blackberry taken from the hedge.
    </p>
    <p>
      That being done, they began God's work, and the shepherd pushed in as
      though it had cost him no trouble, and without thinking about any mark or
      sign, or the promise he had made to the shepherdess, for all that he had
      he buried up to the hilt, and if he had had more he would have found a
      place to put it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pretty shepherdess, who had never had such a wedding, enjoyed herself
      so much that she would willingly have done nothing else all her life. The
      battle being ended, both went to look after their sheep, which had
      meanwhile strayed some distance. They being brought together again, the
      shepherd, who was called Hacquin, to pass the time, sat in a swing set up
      between two hedges, and there he swung, as happy as a king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shepherdess sat by the side of a ditch, and made a wreath of flowers.
      She sang a little song, hoping that it would attract the shepherd, and he
      would begin the game over again&mdash;but that was very far from his
      thoughts. When she found he did not come, she began to call, "Hacquin!
      Hacquin!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And he replied, "What do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here! come here! will you?" she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hacquin had had a surfeit of pleasure and he replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "In God's name leave me alone. I am doing nothing; and enjoying myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the shepherdess cried;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, Hacquin; I will let you go in further, without making any
      mark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John," said Hacquin, "I went far beyond the mark, and I do not
      want any more."
    </p>
    <p>
      He would not go to the shepherdess, who was much vexed to have to remain
      idle.

      STORY THE EIGHTY-THIRD &mdash; THE GLUTTONOUS MONK.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Vaurin.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a Carmelite monk who came to preach at a village and after his
        sermon, he went to dine with a lady, and how he stuffed out his gown, as
        you will hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It is the custom of all countries for religious mendicants&mdash;Jacobins,
      Cordeliers, Carmelites, and Augustinians&mdash;to go through all the towns
      and villages, preaching against vice, and exalting and praising virtue.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened once that a Carmelite, from the convent of Arras, arrived one
      Sunday morning, at Libers, a pretty, little town of Artois, to preach&mdash;which
      he could do piously and eloquently, for he was a learned man and a good
      orator.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst the curé was chanting high Mass, our Carmelite wandered about,
      hoping to find some one who wanted a Mass said, whereby the monk could
      earn a few pence, but no one came forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing this, an old widow lady took compassion on him, allowed him to say
      a Mass, and then sent her servant to give him two <i>patars</i>, and to
      beg him to come to dinner with her that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master monk snapped up the money, and accepted the invitation, and as soon
      as he had preached his sermon, and high Mass was finished, he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady for whom he had said Mass, and who had invited him, left the
      church with her maid, and went home to make all ready for the preacher,
      who was conducted to the house by one of her servants, and most
      courteously received. After he had washed his hands, the lady assigned him
      a place by her side, and the varlet and the maid-servant prepared to serve
      the repast, and first they brought in leek soup, with a good piece of
      bacon, a dish of pig's chitterlings, and an ox tongue, roasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      God knows that as soon as the monk saw the viands he drew forth from his
      girdle a fine, long, large, and very sharp knife, and, as he said <i>Benedicite</i>,
      he set to work in the leek soup.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon he had finished that and the bacon as well, and drew towards him
      the fine, fat chitterlings, and rioted amongst them like a wolf amongst a
      flock of sheep; and before his hostess had half finished her soup there
      was not the ghost of a chitterling left in the dish. Then he took the ox
      tongue, and with his sharp knife cut off so many slices that not a morsel
      remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady, who watched all this without saying a word, often glanced at the
      varlet and the servant-maid, and they smiled quietly and glanced at her.
      Then they brought a piece of good salt beef, and a capital piece of
      mutton, and put them on the table. And the good monk, who had an appetite
      like a hungry dog, attacked the beef, and if he had had little pity for
      the chitterlings and the ox tongue, still less had he for this fine piece
      of larded beef.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hostess who took great pleasure in seeing him eat&mdash;which was more
      than the varlet and the maid, did for they cursed him beneath their breath&mdash;always
      filled his cup as soon as it was empty; and you may guess that if he did
      not spare the meat neither did he spare the drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in such a hurry to line his gown that he would hardly say a word.
      When the beef was all finished, and great part of the mutton&mdash;of
      which his hostess had scarcely eaten a mouthful&mdash;she, seeing that her
      guest was not yet satisfied, made a sign to the servant-maid to bring a
      huge ham which had been cooked the day before for the household.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maid&mdash;cursing the priest for gorging so&mdash;obeyed the order of
      her mistress, and put the ham on the table. The good monk, without staying
      to ask "who goes there", fell upon it tooth and nail, and at the very
      first attack he carried off the knuckle, then the thick end, and so
      dismembered it that soon there was nothing left but the bone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The serving man and woman did not laugh much at this, for he had entirely
      cleared the larder, and they were half afraid that he would eat them as
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      To shorten the story&mdash;after all these before mentioned dishes, the
      lady caused to be placed on the table a fine fat cheese, and a dish well
      furnished with tarts, apples, and cheeses, with a good piece of fresh
      butter&mdash;of all which there was not a scrap left to take away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dinner which has been described being thus finished, our preacher, who
      was now as round as a tick, pronounced grace, and then said to his
      hostess;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damsel, I thank you for your good gifts; you have given me a hearty
      welcome, for which I am much obliged to you. I will pray to Him who fed
      five thousand men with a few loaves of barley bread and two small fishes,
      and after they were all filled there remained over twelve basketfuls&mdash;I
      will pray to Him to reward you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. John!" said the maid-servant coming forward, "you may well talk
      about that. I believe that if you had been one of that multitude there
      would not have been anything left over; for you would have eaten up
      everything, and me into the bargain, if I had happened to have been
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, truly, my dear," replied the monk, who was a jovial fellow with a
      ready wit, "I should not have eaten you, but I should have spitted you,
      and put you down to roast&mdash;that is what I should have done to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady began to laugh, and so did the varlet and the maid-servant, in
      spite of themselves. And our monk, who had his belly well stuffed, again
      thanked his hostess for having so well filled him, and went off to another
      village to earn his supper&mdash;but whether that was as good as his
      dinner I cannot say.

    <h3>
      By The Marquis De Rothelin.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of one of his marshals who married the sweetest and most lovable
        woman there was in all Germany. Whether what I tell you is true&mdash;for
        I do not swear to it that I may not be considered a liar&mdash;you will
        see more plainly below.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Whilst we are waiting tor some one to come forward and tell us a good
      story, I will relate a little one which will not detain you long, but is
      quite true, and happened lately.
    </p>
    <p>
      I had a marshal, who had served me long and faithfully, and who determined
      to get a wife, and was married to the most ill-tempered woman in all the
      country; and when he found that neither by good means or bad could he cure
      her of her evil temper, he left her, and would not live with her, but
      avoided her as he would a tempest, for if he knew she was in any place he
      would go in the contrary direction. When she saw that he avoided her, and
      that he gave her no opportunity of displaying her temper, she went in
      search of him, and followed him, crying God knows what, whilst he held his
      tongue and pursued his road, and this only made her worse and she bestowed
      more curses and maledictions on her poor husband than a devil would on a
      damned soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day she, finding that her husband did not reply a word to anything she
      said, followed him through the street, crying as loud as she could before
      all the people;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come here, traitor! speak to me. I belong to you. I belong to you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And my marshal replied each time; "I give my share to the devil! I give my
      share to the devil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they went all through the town of Lille, she crying all the while "I
      belong to you," and the other replying "I give my share to the devil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards, so God willed, this good woman died, and my marshal was
      asked if he were much grieved at the loss of his wife, and he replied that
      never had such a piece of luck occurred to him, and if God had promised
      him anything he might wish, he would have wished for his wife's death;
      "for she," he said, "was so wicked and malicious that if I knew she were
      in paradise I would not go there, for there could be no peace in any place
      where she was. But I am sure that she is in hell, for never did any
      created thing more resemble a devil than she did." Then they said to him;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Really you ought to marry again. You should look out for some good,
      quiet, honest woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry?" said he. "I would rather go and hang myself on a gibbet than
      again run the danger of finding such a hell as I have&mdash;thank God&mdash;now
      escaped from."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he lived, and still lives&mdash;but I know not what he will be.

      STORY THE EIGHTY-FIFTH &mdash; NAILED! <a href="#linklinknote-85"
      name="linklinknoteref-85" id="linklinknoteref-85">85</a>
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Santilly.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a goldsmith, married to a fair, kind, and gracious lady, and very
        amorous withal of a curé, her neighbour, with whom her husband found her
        in bed, they being betrayed by one of the goldsmith's servants, who was
        jealous, as you will hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A hundred years ago, or thereabouts, there happened in a town on the
      borders of France a curious incident, which I will relate, to increase my
      number of stories, and also because it deserves to rank with the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this town there was a man whose wife was fair, kind, and gracious, and
      much enamoured of a churchman, her own curé and near neighbour, who loved
      her as much as she did him, but to find an opportunity to come together
      amorously was difficult, but it was at last found by the ingenuity of the
      lady, in the manner I will describe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband was a goldsmith, and so greedy of gain that he would never
      sleep an hour in which he could work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every day he would rise an hour or two before dawn, and let his wife take
      a long rest till eight or nine o'clock, or as long as she pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      This amorous dame seeing how diligent her husband was, and that he rose
      early every day to hammer and work, determined to employ with the curé the
      time during which she was neglected by her husband, and arranged that at
      such and such an hour her lover could visit her without her husband's
      knowledge, for the cure's house stood next to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      This happy expedient was proposed to the curé, who gladly accepted it, for
      it seemed to him that his amour could be carried on easily and secretly.
      So as soon as the proposal was made it was executed, and thus they
      continued to live for a long time; but fortune&mdash;envious perhaps of
      their happiness and sweet enjoyment&mdash;willed that their amours should
      be unfortunately discovered in the manner you will hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      This goldsmith had an assistant, who was in love with his master's wife,
      and very jealous of her, and he perceived the curé often talking to the
      lady, and he guessed what was the matter. But he could not imagine how and
      when they met, unless it was that the curé came in the morning when he and
      his master were in the workshop. These suspicions so ran in his head that
      he watched and listened in order that he might find out the truth, and he
      watched so well that he learned the facts of the case, for one morning he
      saw the curé come, soon after the goldsmith had left the chamber, and
      enter and close the door after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was quite sure that his suspicions were confirmed, he informed his
      master of his discovery in these terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Master, I serve you, not only that I may earn your money, eat your bread,
      and do your work well and honestly, but also to protect your honour and
      preserve it from harm. If I acted otherwise I should not be worthy to be
      your servant. I have long had a suspicion that our curé was doing you a
      grievous wrong, but I said nothing to you until I was sure of the facts.
      That you may not suppose I am trumping up an idle story, I would beg of
      you to let us go now to your chamber, for I am sure that we shall find him
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the good man heard this news, he was much inclined to laugh, but he
      agreed to go to his chamber along with his assistant&mdash;who first made
      him promise that he would not kill the curé, or otherwise he would not
      accompany him, but consented that the curé should be well punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went up to the chamber, and the door was soon opened. The husband
      entered first, and saw his wife in the arms of the curé who was forging as
      hard as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goldsmith cried;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Die, die, scoundrel! What brings you here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The curé was surprised and alarmed, and begged for mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence, rascally priest, or I will kill you on the spot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, neighbour have mercy, for God's sake," said the curé; "do with me
      whatever you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my father's soul! before I let you go I will make you so that you will
      never want to hammer on any feminine anvil again. Get up, and let yourself
      be bound, unless you wish to die!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor wretch allowed himself to be fastened by his two enemies to a
      bench, face upwards, and with his legs hanging down on each side of the
      bench. When he was well fastened, so that he could move nothing but his
      head, he was carried thus trussed (*) into a little shed behind the house,
      which the goldsmith used as a melting-room.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) The word in the original is <i>marescaucié</i>, which
     presumably means,&mdash;treated as the soldiers of the
     <i>maréchaussée</i> treated their prisoners. Bibliophile Jacob
     avoided philological pitfalls of this sort by omitting the
     phrase altogether.
</pre>
    <p>
      When the curé was safely placed in this shed, the goldsmith sent for two
      long nails with large heads, and with these he fastened to the bench the
      two hammers which had in his absence forged on his wife's anvil, and after
      that undid all the ropes which fastened the poor wretch. Then taking a
      handful of straw, he set fire to the shed, and leaving the curé to his
      fate, rushed into the street, crying "Fire!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The priest, finding himself surrounded by flames, saw that he must either
      lose his genitals or be burned alive, so he jumped up and ran away,
      leaving his purse nailed there.
    </p>
    <p>
      An alarm was soon raised in the street, and the neighbours ran to put out
      the fire. But the curé sent them back, saying that he had just come from
      the spot, and all the harm that could occur had already been done, so that
      they could give no assistance&mdash;but he did not say that it was he who
      had suffered all the harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus was the poor curé rewarded for his love, through the false and
      treacherous jealousy of the goldsmith's assistant, as you have heard.

    <h2>
      STORY THE EIGHTY-SIXTH &mdash; FOOLISH FEAR.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur Philippe Vignier.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a young man of Rouen, married to a fair, young girl of the age of
        fifteen or thereabouts; and how the mother of the girl wished to have
        the marriage annulled by the Judge of Rouen, and of the sentence which
        the said Judge pronounced when he had heard the parties&mdash;as you
        will hear more plainly in the course of the said story.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the good town of Rouen, not long ago, a young man was married to a fair
      and tender virgin, aged fifteen, or thereabouts. On the day of the great
      feast&mdash;that is to say, the wedding&mdash;the mother of the young
      girl, as is customary in such cases, instructed the bride in all the
      mysteries of wedlock, and taught her how to behave to her husband on the
      first night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young girl, who was looking forward to the time when she could put
      these doctrines into practice, took great pains and trouble to remember
      the lesson given her by her good mother, and it seemed to her that when
      the time came for her to put these counsels into execution, that she would
      perform her duties so well that her husband would praise her, and be well
      pleased with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding was performed with all honour and due solemnity, and the
      desired night came; and soon after the feast was ended, and the young
      people had withdrawn after having taken leave of the newly married couple,&mdash;the
      mother, cousins, neighbours, and other lady friends led the bride to the
      chamber where she was to spend the night with her husband, where they
      joyfully divested her of her raiment, and put her to bed, as was right and
      proper. Then they wished her good-night, and one said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, may God give you joy and pleasure in your husband, and may you
      so live with him as to be for the salvation of both your souls."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another said: "My dear, God give you such peace and happiness with your
      husband, that the heavens may be filled with your works."
    </p>
    <p>
      After they all had expressed similar wishes, they left. The bride's
      mother, who remained the last, questioned her daughter to see whether she
      remembered the lesson she had been taught. And the girl, who, as the
      proverb goes, did not carry her tongue in her pocket, replied that she
      well remembered all that had been told her, and&mdash;thank God&mdash;had
      forgotten nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well done," said the mother. "Now I will leave you, and recommend you to
      God, and pray that He may give you good luck. Farewell, my dear child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Farewell, my good and wise mother."
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the schoolmistress had finished, the husband who was outside
      the door expecting something better, came in. The mother closed the door,
      and told him that she hoped he would be gentle with her daughter. He
      promised that he would, and as soon as he had bolted the door, he&mdash;who
      had on nothing on but his doublet,&mdash;threw it off, jumped on the bed,
      drew as close as he could to his bride, and, lance in hand, prepared to
      give battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when he approached the barrier where the skirmish was to take place,
      the girl laid hold of his lance, which was as straight and stiff as a
      cowkeeper's horn, and when she felt how hard and big it was, she was very
      frightened, and began to cry aloud, and said that her shield was not
      strong enough to receive and bear the blows of such a huge weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do all he would, the husband could not persuade her to joust with him, and
      this bickering lasted all night, without his being able to do anything,
      which much displeased our bridegroom. Nevertheless, he was patient, hoping
      to make up for lost time the next night, but it was the same as the first
      night, and so was the third, and so on up to the fifteenth, matters
      remaining just as I have told you.
    </p>
    <p>
      When fifteen days had passed since the young couple had been married, and
      they had still not come together, the mother came to visit her pupil, and
      after a thousand questions, spoke to the girl of her husband, and asked
      what sort of man he was, and whether he did his duty well? And the girl
      said that he was a nice, young man, quiet and peaceable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But," said the mother; "does he do what he ought to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," said the girl, "but&mdash;&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But <i>what?</i>" said the mother. "You are keeping something back I am
      sure. Tell me at once, and conceal nothing; for I must know now. Is he a
      man capable of performing his marital duties in the way I taught you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl, being thus pressed, was obliged to own that he had not yet
      done the business, but she did not say that she was the cause of the
      delay, and that she had always refused the combat.
    </p>
    <p>
      When her mother heard this sad news, God knows what a disturbance she
      made, swearing by all her gods that she would soon find a remedy for that,
      for she was well acquainted with the judge of Rouen, who was her friend,
      and would favour her cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The marriage must be annulled," she said, "and I have no doubt that I
      shall be able to find out the way, and you may be sure, my child, that
      before two days are over you will be divorced and married to another man
      who will not let you rest in peace all that time. You leave the matter to
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good woman, half beside herself, went and related her wrong to her
      husband, the father of the girl, and told him that they had lost their
      daughter, and adducing many reasons why the marriage should be annulled.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pleaded her cause so well that her husband took her side, and was
      content that the bridegroom, (who knew no reason why a complaint should be
      lodged against him) should be cited before the Judge. But, at any rate, he
      was personally summoned to appear before the Judge, at his wife's demand,
      to show cause why he should not leave her, and permit her to marry again,
      or explain the reasons why, in so many days that he had lived with her, he
      had not demonstrated that he was a man, and performed the duties that a
      husband should.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the day came, the parties presented themselves at the proper time and
      place, and they were called upon to state their case. The mother of the
      bride began to plead her daughter's cause, and God knows the laws
      concerning marriage which she quoted, none of which, she maintained, had
      her son-in-law fulfilled; therefore she demanded that he should be
      divorced from her daughter at once without any more ado.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man was much astonished to find himself thus attacked, but lost
      no time in replying to the allegations of his adversary, and quietly
      stated his case, and related how his wife had always refused to allow him
      to perform his marital duties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother, when she heard this reply, was more angry than ever, and would
      hardly believe it, and asked her daughter if that was true which her
      husband had said?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, truly, mother," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, wretched girl," said her mother, "why did you refuse? Did I not teach
      you your lesson many times?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl could not reply, so ashamed was she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate," said her mother, "I must know the reason why you have
      refused. Tell it me at once, or I shall be horrible angry."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was obliged to confess that she had found the lance of the
      champion so big that she had not dared to present her shield, fearing that
      he would kill her; and so she still felt, and was not re-assured upon that
      point, although her mother had told her not be afraid. After this the
      mother addressed the Judge, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur, you have heard the confession of my daughter, and the
      defence of my son-in-law. I beg of you to give judgment at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge ordered a bed to be prepared in his house, and the couple to lie
      on it together, and commanded the bride to boldly lay hold of the stick or
      instrument, and put it where it was ordered to go. When this judgment was
      given, the mother said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my lord; you have well judged. Come along, my child, do what
      you should, and take care not to disobey the judge, and put the lance
      where it ought to be put."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am satisfied," said the daughter, "to put it where it ought to go, but
      it may rot there before I will take it out again."
    </p>
    <p>
      So they left the Court, and went and carried out the sentence themselves,
      without the aid of any sergeants. By this means the young man enjoyed his
      joust, and was sooner sick of it than she who would not begin.

    <h2>
      STORY THE EIGHTY-SEVENTH &mdash; WHAT THE EYE DOES NOT SEE.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monsieur Le Voyer.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a gentle knight who was enamoured of a young and beautiful girl,
        and how he caught a malady in one of his eyes, and therefore sent for a
        doctor, who likewise fell in love with the same girl, as you will hear;
        and of the words which passed between the knight and the doctor
        concerning the plaster which the doctor had put on the knight's good
        eye.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the pleasant and fertile land of Holland, not a hundred years ago, a
      noble knight lodged in a fair and good inn, where there was a young and
      very pretty chamber-maid, with whom he was greatly enamoured, and for love
      of her had arranged with the Duke of Burgundy's quartermaster that he
      should be lodged in this inn, in order that he might better carry out his
      intentions with regard to this girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had been at this inn five or six days, there happened to him a
      misfortune, for he had a disease in one of his eyes so that he could not
      keep it open, so sharp was the pain. And as he much feared to lose it, and
      it was an organ that required much care and attention, he sent for the
      Duke's surgeon, who was at that time in the the town. And you must know
      that the said surgeon was a good fellow, and much esteemed and spoken
      about throughout all the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the surgeon saw this eye, he declared that it could not be
      saved, which is what they customarily say, so that if they do cure the
      disease they may gain more praise and profit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good knight was greatly vexed at this news, and asked if there were no
      means of cure, and the other replied that it would be very difficult,
      nevertheless he might, with God's aid, cure it, if the knight would obey
      all his instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you can cure me and save my eye," said the knight, "I will pay you
      well."
    </p>
    <p>
      The bargain was made, and the surgeon undertook with God's aid to cure the
      bad eye, and arranged at what hour he would come every day to apply the
      dressings.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must know that every time the surgeon came to see his patient, the
      pretty chambermaid accompanied him, to hold his box or basin, or help to
      move the poor patient, who forgot half his pain in the presence of his
      lady-love.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the good knight had been struck by the beauty of the chambermaid, so
      also was the surgeon; who, each time that he paid a visit, could not help
      casting sheep's eyes at the fair face of the chambermaid, and at last
      passionately declared his love, which was well received, for she
      immediately granted his requests, but it was not easy to find means to
      carry out their ardent desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, after some trouble, a plan was hit on by the prudent and cunning
      surgeon, and it was this:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will tell my patient," he said, "that his eye cannot be cured unless
      his other eye is bandaged, for by throwing all the work on the sound eye
      he prevents the other from getting well. If he will allow it to be
      bandaged up, we shall have a capital means of taking our pleasure, even in
      his chamber, without his having any suspicion of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, whose desires were quite as warm as those of the surgeon, was
      quite agreeable, provided the plan could be carried out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We will try," said the surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came at the usual hour to see the bad eye, and when he had uncovered
      it, pretended to be much surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What!" he cried. "I never saw such a disease; the eye is worse than it
      was fifteen days ago. You must have patience, monsieur."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what way?" said the knight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your good eye must be bandaged and concealed, so that no light can reach
      it, for an hour or so after I have applied this plaster and ordered
      another&mdash;for, no doubt, it prevents the other from healing. Ask," he
      said, "this pretty girl, who sees it every day, how it is getting on."
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl said that it looked worse than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said the knight, "I leave myself in your hands; do with me
      whatever you please. I am content to be blindfolded as much as you like,
      provided I am cured in the long run."
    </p>
    <p>
      The two lovers were very joyful when they saw that the knight allowed his
      eyes to be bandaged. When all the arrangements had been made, and the
      knight had his eyes bandaged, master surgeon pretended to leave as usual,
      promising to come back soon to take off the bandage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not go very far, for he threw the girl on a couch not far from the
      patient, and with quite a different instrument to that which he had
      employed on the knight, visited the secret cloisters of the chambermaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three, four, five, six times did he perform on the pretty girl without the
      knight noticing it, for though he heard the storm he did not know what it
      was; but as it still continued, his suspicions were aroused, and this
      time, when he heard the noise of the combat, he tore off the bandages and
      plasters and threw them away, and saw the two lovers struggling together,
      and seeming as though they would eat each other, so closely united were
      their mouths.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this, master surgeon?" cried he. "Have you blindfolded me in
      order to do me this wrong. Is my eye to be cured by this means? Tell me&mdash;did
      you prepare this trick for me? By St. John, I suspect I was more often
      visited for love of my chambermaid than for my eyes. Well! well! I am in
      your hands now, sir, and cannot yet revenge myself, but the day will come
      when I will make you remember me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon, who was a thoroughly good fellow, began to laugh, and made
      his peace with the knight, and I believe that, after the eye was cured,
      they agreed to divide the work between them.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Alardin.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a poor, simple peasant married to a nice, pleasant woman, who did
        much as she liked, and who in order that she might be alone with her
        lover, shut up her husband in the pigeon-house in the manner you will
        hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In a pretty, little town near here, but which I will not name, there
      recently occurred an incident which will furnish a short story. There
      lived there a good, simple, unlettered peasant, married to a nice,
      pleasant woman, and as long as he had plenty to eat and drink he cared for
      little else. He was accustomed to often go into the country to a house he
      had there, and stay, three, or four days&mdash;sometimes more, sometimes
      less, as suited his pleasure, and left his wife to enjoy herself in the
      town, which she did, for, in order that she might not be frightened, she
      had always a man to take her husband's place, and look after the workshop
      and see that the tools did not rust. Her method was to wait until her
      husband was out of sight, and not until she was quite sure that he would
      not return did she send for his deputy, in order that she might not be
      surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she could not always manage so well as not to be surprised, for once
      when her husband had remained away two or three days, and on the fourth
      day she had waited as long as possible until the gates of the town were
      closed; thinking he would not come that day, she closed the doors and the
      windows as on the other days, brought her lover into the house, and they
      began to drink and enjoy themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were scarcely seated at the table, when her husband came and
      thundered at the door, which he was much surprised to find closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the good woman heard it, she hid her lover under the bed; then went
      to the door and demanded who knocked?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open the door," replied her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, husband, is that you?" she said. "I was going to send a message to
      you to-morrow morning to tell you not to come back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why; what is the matter?" asked her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the matter? God in heaven!" she replied. "The sergeants were here
      two hours and a half, waiting to take you to prison."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To prison!" said he; "Why to prison? Have I done anything wrong? To whom
      do I owe any money? Who brings any charge against me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know nothing about it," said the cunning wench, "but they evidently
      wanted to do you harm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But did they not tell you," asked her husband, "why they wanted me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she replied; "nothing, except that if they laid hands on you, you
      would not get out of prison for a long time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God they haven't caught me yet. Good bye, I am going back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are you going?" she asked&mdash;though she was glad to get rid of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whence I came," he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will come with you," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, don't. Stay and take care of the house, and do not tell anyone that I
      have been here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since you will return to the country," she said, "make haste and get away
      before they close the gates: it is already late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If they should be shut, the gate-keeper will do anything for me and he
      will open them again."
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words he left, and when he came to the gate, he found it
      closed, and, beg and pray as he might, the gate-keeper would not open it
      for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very annoyed that he should have to return to his house, for he
      feared the sergeants; nevertheless, he was obliged to go back, or sleep in
      the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went back, and knocked at the door, and the woman who had again sat
      down with her lover, was much surprised, but she jumped up, and ran to the
      door, and called out,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband has not come back; you are wasting your time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Open the door, my dear," said the good man. "I am here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! alas! the gate was closed: I feared as much," she said. "You will
      certainly be arrested; I see no hope for escape, for the sergeants told
      me, I now remember, that they would return to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well," he said, "there is no need of a long sermon. Let us consider
      what is to be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must hide somewhere in the house," she said, "and I do not know of
      any place where you would be safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Should I be safe," he asked, "in our pigeon house? Who would look for me
      there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was, of course, highly delighted at the suggestion, but pretended not
      to be, and said; "It is not a very nice place; it stinks too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind that," he said. "I would rather be there an hour or two, and
      be safe, than be in a better place and be caught."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well, if you are brave enough to go there, I am of your opinion that
      it would be a good hiding-place."
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor man ascended into the pigeon-house, which fastened outside, and
      was locked in, and told his wife that if the sergeants did not come soon,
      that she was to let him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      She left him to coo with the pigeons all night, which he did not much
      like, and he was afraid to speak or call, for fear of the sergeants.
    </p>
    <p>
      At daybreak, which was the time when her lover left the house, the good
      woman came and called her husband and opened the door; and he asked her
      why she had left him so long along with the pigeons. And she, having
      prepared her reply, said that the sergeants had watched round their house
      all night, and spoken to her several times, and had only just gone, but
      they said that they would come back at a time when they were likely to
      find him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor fellow, much wondering what the sergeants could want with him,
      left at once, and returned to the country, vowing that he would not come
      back for a long time. God knows how pleased the wench was at this, though
      she pretended to be grieved. And by this means she enjoyed herself more
      than ever, for she had no longer any dread of her husband's return.

      STORY THE EIGHTY-NINTH &mdash; THE FAULT OF THE ALMANAC.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Poncelet.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a curé who forgot, either by negligence or ignorance, to inform
        his parishioners that Lent had come until Palm Sunday arrived, as you
        will hear&mdash;and of the manner in which he excused himself to his
        parishioners.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In a certain little hamlet or village in this country, far from any good
      town, there happened an incident, which is worth hearing, my good sirs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This village or hamlet was inhabited by a handful of rough and simple
      peasants, who knew nothing except how to gain their livelihood. Rough and
      ignorant as they were, their curé was not less so, for he did not know
      things of common knowledge, as I will show you by relating an incident
      that happened to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must know that this curé was so simple and ignorant that he could not
      announce the feasts of the saints, which come every year on a fixed day,
      as every one knows; and when his parishioners asked when such and such a
      feast would fall, he could not, right off, answer them correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst other such mistakes, which often occurred, he made one which was
      by no means slight, for he allowed the five weeks of Lent to slip by
      without informing his parishioners.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hear how he discovered his error. On the Saturday which was the eve
      before Palm Sunday, he had need to go to the nearest town for something
      that he required. When he had entered the town, and was riding along the
      streets, he saw that the priests were purchasing palms and other
      greenstuff, which were being sold at the market for the procession the
      next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anyone was astonished it was our good curé, though he pretended not to
      be. He went to the woman who sold the palms and boughs, and bought some&mdash;pretending
      that he had come to town specially for that purpose. Then he hastily
      mounted his horse, which was loaded with his purchases, galloped to the
      village, and arrived there as quickly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he had dismounted, he met several of his parishioners, whom he
      commanded to go and ring the bells for every one to come to church at
      once, for he had certain things necessary for the salvation of their souls
      to tell them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A meeting was soon called, and all were assembled in the church, where the
      curé, booted and spurred, came, much flustered, God knows. He mounted into
      the pupil, and said the following words,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good sirs, I have to signify and inform you that to-day was the eve of
      the solemn feast of Palm Sunday, and this day next week will be the eve of
      Easter Sunday, the day of Our Lord's Resurrection."
    </p>
    <p>
      When these good people heard this news they began to murmur, and were so
      astonished they did not know what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Silence!" said the curé, "I will soon satisfy you, and will tell you the
      true reasons why you have only eight days of Lent in which to perform your
      penitences this year, and marvel not at what I am about to tell you, as to
      why Lent came so late. I suppose there is not one amongst you who does not
      know and remember that the frosts were very long and sharp this year&mdash;much
      worse than ever they were&mdash;and that for many weeks it was dangerous
      to ride, on account of the frost and the snow, which lasted a long time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every one here knows that is as true as the Gospel, therefore be not
      astonished that Lent has been so long coming, but rather wonder that it
      was able to come at all, seeing how long the road is from here to his
      house. I would ask, and even beg of you, to excuse him, for I dined with
      him to day" (and he named the place&mdash;that is to say the town to which
      he had been).
    </p>
    <p>
      "However," he added, "manage to come and confess this week, and appear to
      morrow in the procession, as is customary. And have patience this time;
      the coming year will be milder, please God, and then Lent will come
      quicker, as it usually does."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did the curé find means to excuse his simple ignorance. Then he
      pronounced the benediction saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray to God for me, and I will pray to God for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      After that he came down out of the pulpit, and went to his house to
      prepare the boughs and palms which were to be used in the procession the
      next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that is all.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Beaumont.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a good merchant of Brabant whose wife was very ill, and he
        supposing that she was about to die, after many remonstrances and
        exhortations for the salvation of her soul, asked her pardon, and she
        pardoned him all his misdeeds, excepting that he had not worked her as
        much as he ought to have done&mdash;as will appear more plainly in the
        said story.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      To increase the number of stories that I promised to tell, I will relate a
      circumstance that occurred lately.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the fair land of Brabant&mdash;the place in the world where adventures
      most often happen&mdash;there lived a good and honest merchant, whose wife
      was very ill, and had to keep her bed continually because of her disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good man, seeing his wife so ill and weak, led a sad life; he was so
      vexed and distressed and he much feared she would die. In this state of
      grief, and believing that he was about to lose her, he came to her
      bedside, and gave her hopes of being cured, and comforted her as best he
      could. And after that he had talked with her a little time, and ended his
      admonitions and exhortations, he begged her pardon, and requested that if
      he had ever wronged her in any way that she would pardon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst other instances of things which he knew had annoyed her, he
      mentioned that he had not polished up her armour (that part which is
      called the <i>cuirass</i>) as often as she would have liked, and therefore
      he humbly begged her pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor invalid, as soon as she could speak, pardoned him all his minor
      offences, but this last she would not willingly pardon without knowing the
      reasons which had induced her husband to neglect polishing up her armour
      when he knew well what a pleasure it was to her, and that she asked for
      nothing better.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" he said; "Will you die without pardoning those who have done you
      wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not mind pardoning you," she said, "but I want to know your reasons&mdash;otherwise
      I will not pardon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good husband thought he had hit on a good excuse, and one that would
      obtain his pardon, and replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you know that very often you were ill and weak&mdash;although
      not so ill as I see you now&mdash;and I did not dare to challenge you to
      combat whilst you were in that condition, fearing that it might make you
      worse. But be sure that if I refrained from embracing you, it was only out
      of love and affection to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold your tongue, liar that you are! I was never so ill and weak that I
      should have refused the battle. You must seek some other reason if you
      would obtain your pardon, for that one will not help you; and since there
      is now nothing to be done, I will tell you, wicked and cowardly man that
      you are, that there is no medicine in the world which will so quickly
      drive away the maladies of us women as the pleasant and amorous society of
      men. Do you see me now weakened and dried up with disease? Well! all that
      I want is your company."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ho, ho!" said the other; "then I will quickly cure you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He jumped on the bed and performed as well as he could, and, as soon as he
      had broken two lances, she rose and stood on her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later she was out in the street, and her neighbours, who all
      looked upon her as almost dead, were much astonished, until she told them
      by what means she had been cured, when they at once replied that that was
      the only remedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did the good merchant learn how to cure his wife; but it turned out
      to his disadvantage in the long run, for she often pretended to be sick in
      order to get her physic.

      <p>
        <i> Of a man who was married to a woman so lascivious and lickerish,
        that I believe she must have been born in a stove or half a league from
        the summer sun, for no man, however well he might work, could satisfy
        her; and how her husband thought to punish her, and the answer she gave
        him.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      When I was lately in Flanders, in one of the largest towns in the
      province, a jovial fellow told me a good story of a man married to a woman
      so given to venery and concupiscence that she would have let a man lie
      with her in the public streets. Her husband knew well how she misbehaved
      herself, but he was not clever enough to prevent it, so cunning and
      depraved was she. He threatened to beat, to leave her, or to kill her, but
      it was all a waste of words; he might as well have tried to tame a mad dog
      or some other animal. She was always seeking fresh lovers with whom to
      fornicate, and there were few men in all the country round who had not
      tried to satisfy her lust; anyone who winked at her, even if he were
      humpbacked, old, deformed, or disfigured in any way, could have her
      favours for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her unfortunate husband, seeing that she still continued this life in
      spite of all his menaces, tried to hit upon a method to frighten her. When
      he was alone with her in the house, he said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, Jehanne (or Beatrix, for so he called her) I see that you are
      determined to continue this life of vice, and, however much I may threaten
      to punish you, you take no more heed of me than though I held my tongue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, husband," she replied, "I am much to be pitied, but there is no
      help for it, for I was born under a planet which compels me to go with
      men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed," said the husband, "is that your destiny? I swear I will soon
      find a remedy for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will kill me then," she said, "for nothing else will cure me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never mind," he said. "I know the best way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it?" she asked. "Tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morbleu!" he said, "I will give you such a doing some day, that I will
      put a quartette of babies in your belly, and then I will leave you to get
      your own living."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will?" she cried. "Indeed! Well, you have but to begin. Such threats
      frighten me very little, I do not care a farthing for them. May I have my
      head shaved if I attempt to run away. (*) If you think you are capable of
      making four babies at once, come on, and begin at once&mdash;the mould is
      ready."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) Long hair was considered honourable, and to have the
     head shaved or cropped was a mark of disgrace.
</pre>
    <p>
      "The devil take the woman," said the husband; "there is no way of
      punishing her."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was obliged to let her fulfil her destiny, for nothing short of
      splitting her head open would have kept her backside quiet; so he let her
      run about like a bitch on heat amongst a couple of dozen dogs, and
      accomplish all her inordinate desires.

      STORY THE NINETY-SECOND &mdash; WOMEN'S QUARRELS.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By The Editor.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a married woman who was in love with a Canon, and, to avoid
        suspicion, took with her one of her neighbours when she went to visit
        the Canon; and of the quarrel that arose between the two women, as you
        will hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the noble city of Metz in Lorraine, there lived, some time ago a woman
      who was married, but also belonged to the confraternity of the <i>houlette</i>
      (*); nothing pleased her more than that nice amusement we all know: she
      was always ready to employ her arms, and prove that she was right valiant,
      and cared little for blows.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) "The frail sisterhood".
</pre>
    <p>
      Now hear what happened to her whilst she was exercising her profession.
      She was enamoured of a fat canon, who had more money than an old dog has
      fleas. But as he lived in a place where people came at all hours, she did
      not know how she was to come to her canon un-perceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      She pondered over the matter, and at last determined to take into her
      confidence a neighbour of hers, a sister-in-arms also of the <i>houlette</i>,
      for it seemed to her that she might go and see her canon, if accompanied
      by her neighbour, without causing any suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was devised, so was it done, and she went to see the canon, as
      though on an affair of great importance, and honourably escorted, as has
      been said.
    </p>
    <p>
      To shorten the story, as soon as our <i>bourgeoises</i> arrived, after all
      due salutations, the principal personage shut herself up with her lover,
      the canon, and he gave her a mount, as he well knew how.
    </p>
    <p>
      The neighbour, seeing the other have a private audience with the master of
      the house, had no small envy, and was much displeased that she could not
      do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first-named woman came out of the room, after receiving what she
      came for, she said to her neighbour;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall We go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed," said the other, "am I to go away like that? If I do not
      receive the same courtesy that you did, by God I will reveal everything. I
      did not come to warm the wax for other people."
    </p>
    <p>
      When they saw what she wanted, they offered her the canon's clerk, who was
      a stout and strong gallant well suited for the work, but she refused him
      point blank, saying that she deserved his master and would have none
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canon was obliged, to save his honour, to grant her request, and when
      that was accomplished, she wished to say farewell and leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then the other would not, for she said angrily that it was she who had
      brought her neighbour, and for whom the meeting was primarily intended,
      and she ought to have a bigger share than the other, and that she would
      not leave unless she had another "truss of oats."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Canon was much alarmed when he heard this, and, although he begged the
      woman who wanted the extra turn not to insist, she would not be satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he said, "I am content, since it needs must be; but never come
      back under similar conditions&mdash;I shall be out of town."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the battle was over, the damsel who had had an additional turn, when
      she took leave, asked the canon to give her something as a keepsake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without waiting to be too much importuned, and also to get rid of them,
      the good canon handed them the remainder of a piece of stuff for
      kerchiefs, which he gave them, and the "principal" received the gift, and
      they said farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," he said, "all that I can give you just now; so take it in good
      part."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not gone very far, and were in the street, when the neighbour,
      who had had nothing more than one turn, told her companion that she wanted
      her share of the gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," said the other, "I have no objection. How much do you want?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Need you ask that," said she. "I am going to have half, and you the
      same."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How dare you ask," said the other, "more than you have earned? Have you
      no shame? You know well that you only went once with the canon, and I went
      twice, and, pardieu, it is not right that you should have as much as I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardieu! I will have as much as you," said the second.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I not do my duty as well as you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean by that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is not once as good as ten times? And now that you know my will, instead
      of standing here squabbling over a trifle, I recommend you to give me my
      half, or you will soon see a fight. Do you think you can do as you like
      with me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed!" said the other, "will you try force? By God's power you
      shall only have what is right,&mdash;that is to say one third part&mdash;and
      I will have the rest. Did I not have twice as much trouble as you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      With that the other doubled up her fist and landed it in the face of her
      companion, the one for whom the meeting had been first arranged, who
      quickly returned the blow. In short they fought as though they would have
      killed each other, and called one another foul names. When the people in
      the street saw the fight between the two companions, who a short while
      previously had been so friendly, they were much astonished, and came and
      separated the combatants. Then the husbands were called, and each asked
      his wife the cause of the quarrel. Each tried to make the other in the
      wrong, without telling the real cause, and set their husbands against each
      other so that they fought, and the sergeants came and sent them to cool
      their heels in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Justice intervened, and the two women were compelled to own that the fight
      was about a piece of stuff for a kerchief. The Council, seeing that the
      case did not concern them, sent it to the "King of the Bordels", because
      the women were his subjects. And during the affair the poor husbands
      remained in gaol awaiting sentence, which, owing to the infinite number of
      cases, is likely to remain unsettled for a long time.

        <i>Of a good wife who pretended to her husband that she was going on a
        pilgrimage, in order to find opportunity to be with her lover the
        parish-clerk&mdash;with whom her husband found her; and of what he said
        and did when he saw them doing you know what.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Whilst I have a good audience, let me relate a funny incident which
      happened in the district of Hainault.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a village there, lived a married woman, who loved the parish clerk much
      more than she did her own husband, and in order to find means to be with
      the clerk, she feigned to her husband that she owed a pilgrimage to a
      certain saint, whose shrine was not far from there; which pilgrimage she
      had vowed to make when she was in travail with her last child, begging the
      saint that he would be content that she should go on a certain day she
      named. The good, simple husband, who suspected nothing, allowed her to go
      on this pilgrimage; and as he would have to remain alone he told her to
      prepare both his dinner and supper before she left, or else he would go
      and eat at the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did as he ordered, and prepared a nice chicken and a piece of mutton,
      and when all these preparations were complete, she told her husband that
      everything was now ready, and that she was going to get some holy water,
      and then leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to church, and the first man she met was the one she sought, that
      is to say the clerk, to whom she told the news, that is to say how she had
      been permitted to go on a pilgrimage for the whole day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And this is what will occur," she said. "I am sure that as soon as I am
      out of the house that he will go to the tavern, and not return until late
      in the evening, for I know him of old; and so I should prefer to remain in
      the house, whilst he is away, rather than go somewhere else. Therefore you
      had better come to our house in half an hour, and I will let you in by the
      back door, if my husband is not at home, and if he should be, we will set
      out on our pilgrimage."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went home, and there she found her husband, at which she was not best
      pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! are you still here?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to put on my shoes," she said, "and then I shall not be long
      before I start."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the shoemaker, and whilst she was having her shoes put on, her
      husband passed in front of the cobbler's house, with another man, a
      neighbour, with whom he often went to the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      She supposed that because he was accompanied by this neighbour that they
      were going to the tavern; whereas he had no intention of the kind, but was
      going to the market to find a comrade or two and bring them back to dine
      with him, since he had a good dinner to offer them&mdash;that is to say
      the chicken and the mutton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us leave the husband to find his comrades, and return to the woman who
      was having her shoes put on. As soon as that was completed, she returned
      home as quickly as she could, where she found the scholar wandering round
      the house, and said to him;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, we are the happiest people in the world, for I have seen my
      husband go to the tavern, I am sure, for one of his neighbours was leading
      him by the arm, and I know is not likely to let my man come back, and
      therefore let us be joyful. We have the whole day, till night, to
      ourselves. I have prepared a chicken, and a good piece of mutton, and we
      will enjoy ourselves;" and without another word they entered the house,
      but left the door ajar in order that the neighbours should suspect
      nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us now return to the husband, who had found a couple of boon
      companions besides the one I have mentioned, and now brought them to his
      house to devour the chicken, and drink some good Beaune wine&mdash;or
      better, if they could get it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came to the house, he entered first, and immediately saw our two
      lovers, who were taking a sample of the good work they had to do. And when
      he saw his wife with her legs in the air, he told her that she need not
      have troubled to bother the cobbler about her shoes, since she was going
      to make the pilgrimage in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He called his companions, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good sirs, just see how my wife looks after my interests. For fear that
      she should wear out her new shoes, she is making the journey on her back:&mdash;no
      other woman would have done that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up the remainder of the fowl, and told her that she might finish
      her pilgrimage; then closed the door and left her with her clerk, without
      saying another word, and went off to the tavern. He was not scolded when
      he came back, nor on the other occasions either that he went there,
      because he had said little or nothing concerning the pilgrimage which his
      wife had made at home with her lover, the parish clerk.

      STORY THE NINETY-FOURTH &mdash; DIFFICULT TO PLEASE.
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) There is no author's name to this story in any of the
     editions.
</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a curé who wore a short gown, like a gallant about to be married,
        for which cause he was summoned before the Ordinary, and of the sentence
        which was passed, and the defence he made, and the other tricks he
        played afterwards&mdash;as you will plainly hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In Picardy, in the diocese of Therouenne, there lived about a year and a
      half ago, in one of the large towns, a curé who aped the fashionable youth
      of the time. He wore a short gown, and high boots, as was the fashion at
      Court, and, in short, was as great a gallant as you would see,&mdash;which
      gave no small offence to all good Churchmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ordinary of Therouenne&mdash;who is generally known as the "big devil"
      &mdash;was informed of the behaviour of this curé, and cited him to appear
      to be punished, and ordered to change his method of dressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared in his short gown, as though he cared little for the Ordinary,
      or thinking, perhaps, that he was going to be let off for his good looks,
      but this did not happen, for when he was before the judge, the "promoter"
      related the case at full length, and demanded that these clothes and other
      vanities should be forbidden him, and that he should be condemned to pay
      certain fines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge, seeing at a glance what sort of man our curé was, forbade him,
      by all the penalties of canon law, to disguise himself in the way he had
      done, and ordered that he was to wear long gowns and long hair, and
      moreover, to pay a good sum of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curé promised that he would do so, and never again be summoned for a
      similar offence. He left the Court and returned to his cure, and as soon
      as he came there, he called the draper and the tailor, and he had a gown
      made which trailed three quarters of an ell on the ground; for he told the
      tailor how he had been reproved for wearing a short gown, and ordered to
      wear a long one.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put on this long robe, and allowed his beard and hair to grow, and in
      this habit performed his parochial duties, sang Mass, and did everything
      that a priest has to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      The promoter was soon informed that the curé behaved in a way not
      compatible with good morals, whereupon a fresh summons was issued, and the
      priest appeared in his long gown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this?" asked the judge when the curé appeared before him. "It
      seems that you make fun of the statutes and ordinances of the Church! Why
      do you not dress like the other priests? If it were not for some of your
      friends I should send you to prison."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, monseigneur!" said the curé. "Did you not order me to wear a long
      gown, and long hair? Have I not done as I was commanded? Is not my gown
      long enough? Is not my hair long? What do you wish me to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish," said the judge, "and I command that your gown and hair should be
      half long, neither too much nor too little, and for this great fault that
      you have committed, I condemn you to pay a fine of ten pounds to the
      Prosecutor, twenty pounds to the Chapter, and as much to the Bishop of
      Therouenne for his charities."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our curé was much astonished, but there was nothing for it but to comply.
      He took leave of the judge, and returned to his house, considering how he
      should attire himself in order to obey the judge's sentence. He sent for
      the tailor, whom he ordered to make a gown as long on one side as that we
      have mentioned, and, as short as the first one on the other side, then he
      had himself shaved on one side only&mdash;that on which the gown was short&mdash;and
      in this guise went about the streets, and performed his sacred duties; and
      although he was told this was not right of him, he paid no attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prosecutor was again informed, and cited him to appear a third time.
      When he appeared, God knows how angry the judge was&mdash;he was almost
      beside himself, and, could scarcely sit on the Bench when he saw the curé
      dressed like a mummer. If the priest had been mulcted before he was still
      more so this time, and was condemned to pay very heavy fines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the curé, finding himself thus amerced in fines and amends, said to
      the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all due respect, it seems to me that I have obeyed your orders. Hear
      what I have to say, and I will prove it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he covered his long beard with his hand, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you like, I have no beard." Then, covering the shaved side of his
      face, he said, "If you like, I have a long beard. Is not that what you
      ordered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge, seeing that he had to do with a joker, who was making fun of
      him, sent for a barber and a tailor, and before all the public, had the
      cure's hair and beard dressed, and his gown cut to a proper and reasonable
      length; then he sent him back to his cure where he conducted himself
      properly&mdash;having learned the right manner at the expense of his
      purse.

    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Philippe De Laon.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a monk who feigned to be very ill and in danger of death, that he
        might obtain the favours of a certain young woman in the manner which is
        described hereafter.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      It is usually the case, thank God, that in many religious communities
      there are certain good fellows who can play "base instruments".
    </p>
    <p>
      Apropos of this, there was formerly in a convent at Paris, a good brother,
      a preacher, who was accustomed to visit his female neighbours. One day his
      choice lighted on a very pretty woman, a near neighbour, young, buxom, and
      spirited, and but recently married to a good fellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master monk fell in love with her, and was always thinking and devising
      ways and means by which he could compass his desires&mdash;which were, in
      short, to do you know what. Now he decided, "That is what I'll do." Then
      he changed his mind. So many plans came into his head that he could not
      decide on any; but of one thing he was sure, and that was that words alone
      would never seduce her from the paths of virtue. "For she is too virtuous,
      and too prudent. I shall be obliged, if I want to gain my ends, to gain
      them by cunning and deception."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now listen to the plan the rascal devised, and how he dishonestly trapped
      the poor, little beast, and accomplished his immoral desires, as he
      proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pretended one day to have a bad finger&mdash;that which is nearest to
      the thumb, and is the first of the four on the right hand&mdash;and he
      wrapped it in linen bandages, and anointed it with strong-smelling
      ointments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went about with it thus for a day or two, hanging about the church
      porch, when he thought the aforesaid woman was coming, and God knows what
      pain he pretended to suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silly wench looked on him with pity, and seeing by his face that he
      appeared to be in great pain, she asked him what was the matter; and the
      cunning fox pitched up a piteous tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed, and on the morrow, about the hour of vespers, when the
      good woman was at home alone, the patient came and sat by her, and acted
      the sick man, that anyone who had seen him would have believed that he was
      in great danger. Sometimes he would walk to the window, then back again to
      the woman, and put on so many strange tricks that you would have been
      astonished and deceived if you had seen him. And the poor foolish girl,
      who pitied him so that the tears almost started from her eyes, comforted
      him as best she could,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, Brother Aubrey, have you spoken to such and such physicians?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, certainly, my dear," he replied. "There is not a doctor or surgeon
      in Paris who has not studied my case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what do they say? Will you have to suffer this pain for a long time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! yes; until I die, unless God helps me; for there is but one remedy
      for ray complaint, and I would rather die than reveal what that is,&mdash;for
      it is very far from decent, and quite foreign to my holy profession."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?" cried the poor girl. "Then there is a remedy! Then is it not very
      wrong and sinful of you to allow yourself to suffer thus? Truly it seems
      so to me, for you are in danger of losing sense and understanding, so
      sharp and terrible is the pain."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, very sharp and terrible it is," said Brother Aubrey, "but there!&mdash;God
      sent it; praised be His name. I willingly suffer and bear all, and
      patiently await death, for that is the only remedy indeed&mdash;excepting
      one I mentioned to you&mdash;which can cure me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told you that I should not dare to say what it is,&mdash;and even if I
      were obliged to reveal what it is, I should never have the will or power
      to put it in execution."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By St. Martin!" said the good woman, "it appears to me that you are very
      wrong to talk like that. Pardieu! tell me what will cure you, and I assure
      you that I will do my utmost to help you. Do not wilfully throw away your
      life when help and succour can be brought. Tell me what it is, and you
      will see that I will help you&mdash;I will, pardieu, though it should cost
      me more than you imagine." The monk, finding his neighbour was willing to
      oblige him, after a great number of refusals and excuses, which, for the
      sake of brevity, I omit, said in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since you desire that I should tell you, I will obey. The doctors all
      agreed that there was but one remedy for my complaint, and that was to put
      my finger into the secret place of a clean and honest woman, and keep it
      there for a certain length of time, and afterwards apply a certain
      ointment of which they gave me the receipt. You hear what the remedy is,
      and as I am by disposition naturally modest, I would rather endure and
      suffer all my ills than breathe a word to a living soul. You alone know of
      my sad lot, and that in spite of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" said the good woman, "what I said I would do I will do. I will
      willingly help to cure you, and am well pleased to be able to relieve you
      of the terrible pain which torments you, and find you a place in which you
      can put your sore finger."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May God repay you, damsel," said the monk. "I should never have dared to
      make the request, but since you are kind enough to help me, I shall not be
      the cause of my own death. Let us go then, if it please you, to some
      secret place where no one can see us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It pleases me well," she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she led him to a fair chamber, and closed the door, and laid upon the
      bed, and the monk lifted up her clothes, and instead of the finger of his
      hand, put something hard and stiff in the place. When he had entered, she
      feeling that it was very big, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "How is it that your finger is so swollen? I never heard of anything like
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly," he replied, "it is the disease which made it like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is wonderful," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst this talk was going on, master monk accomplished that for which he
      had played the invalid so long. She when she felt&mdash;et cetera&mdash;asked
      what that was, and he replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the boil on my finger which has burst. I am cured I think&mdash;thank
      God and you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my word I am pleased to hear it," said the woman as she rose from the
      bed. "If you are not quite cured, come back as often as you like;&mdash;for
      to remove your pain there is nothing I would not do. And another time do
      not be so modest when it is a question of recovering your health."

    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a foolish and rich village curé who buried his dog in the
        church-yard; for which cause he was summoned before his Bishop, and how
        he gave 60 gold crowns to the Bishop, and what the Bishop said to him&mdash;which
        you will find related here.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Listen if you please to what happened the other day to a simple village
      curé. This good curé had a dog which he had brought up, and which
      surpassed every other dog in the country in fetching a stick out of the
      water, or bringing a hat that his master had forgotten, and many other
      tricks. In short, this wise and good dog excelled in everything, and his
      master so loved him that he never tired of singing his praises.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, I know not how, whether he ate something that disagreed with him,
      or whether he was too hot or too cold, the poor dog became very ill, and
      died, and went straightway to wherever all good dogs do go.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did the honest curé do? You must know that his vicarage adjoined the
      church-yard, and when he saw his poor dog quit this world, he thought so
      wise a beast ought not to be without a grave, so he dug a hole near the
      door of his house, and in the church-yard, and there buried his dog. I do
      not know if he gave the dog a monument and an epitaph, I only know that
      the news of the good dog's death spread over the village, and at last
      reached the ears of the Bishop, together with the report that his master
      had given him holy burial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curé was summoned to appear before the Bishop, who sent a sergeant to
      fetch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" said the curé, "what have I done, and why have I to appear before
      the Bishop? I am much surprised at receiving this summons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for me," said the sergeant, "I do not know what it is for, unless it
      is because you buried your dog in the holy ground which is reserved for
      the bodies of Christians."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," thought the curé to himself, "that must be it," and it occurred to
      him that he had done wrong, but he knew that he could easily escape being
      put into prison, by paying a fine, for the Lord Bishop&mdash;God be
      praised&mdash;was the most avaricious prelate in the Kingdom, and only
      kept those about him who knew how to bring grist to the mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At any rate I shall have to pay, and it may as well be soon as late."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the appointed day, he appeared before the Bishop, who immediately
      delivered a long sermon about the sin of burying a dog in consecrated
      ground, and enlarged on the offence so wonderfully that he made it appear
      that the curé had done something worse than deny God; and at the end he
      ordered the curé to be put in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the curé found that he was to be shut up in the stone box, he
      demanded permission to be heard, and the Bishop gave him leave to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      You must know that there were a number of notable persons at this
      convocation&mdash;the judge, the prosecutor, the secretaries, and
      notaries, advocates, and procureurs, who were all much amused at this
      unusual case of the poor curé who had buried his dog in consecrated
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curé spoke briefly in his defence, to this effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Truly, my Lord Bishop, if you had known my poor dog as well as I did, you
      would not be surprised that I gave him Christian burial, for his like was
      never seen;" and then he began to recount his doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as he was so good and wise when he was living, he was still more so
      at his death; for he made a beautiful will, and, as he knew your poverty
      and need, he left you fifty golden crowns, which I now bring you."
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he drew the money from his bosom and gave it to the Bishop, who
      willingly received it, and greatly praised the good dog, and approved of
      his will, and was glad to know that he had received honourable sepulture.

    <h2>
      STORY THE NINETY-SEVENTH &mdash; BIDS AND BIDDINGS.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Monseigneur De Launoy.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a number of boon companions making good cheer and drinking at a
        tavern, and how one of them had a quarrel with his wife when he returned
        home, as you will hear.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      A number of good fellows had once assembled to make good cheer at the
      tavern and drink as much as they could. And when they had eaten and drunk
      to God's praise and <i>usque ad Hebreos</i> (*), and had paid their
      reckoning, some of them began to say, "How shall we be received by our
      wives when we return home?" "God knows if we shall be excommunicated."
      "They will pluck us by the beard." "By Our Lady!" said one, "I am afraid
      to go home." "God help me! so am I," said another. "I shall be sure to
      hear a sermon for Passion Sunday." "Would to God that my wife were dumb&mdash;I
      should drink more boldly than I do now."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) A pun on the word <i>ebreos</i> (drunken).
</pre>
    <p>
      So spoke all of them with one exception, and that was a good fellow who
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      "How now, good sirs? You all seem every miserable, and each has a wife who
      forbids him to go to the tavern, and is displeased if you drink. Thank God
      my wife is not one of that sort, for if I drink ten&mdash;or even a
      hundred-times a day that is not enough for her,&mdash;in short I never
      knew an instance in which she did not wish I had drunk as much again. For,
      when I come back from the tavern she always wishes that I had the rest of
      the barrel in my belly, and the barrel along with it. Is not that a sign
      that I do not drink enough to please her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      When his companions heard this argument they began to laugh, and all
      praised his wife, and then each one went his own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good fellow we have mentioned, went home, where he found his wife not
      over friendly, and ready to scold him; and as soon as she saw him she
      began the usual lecture, and, as usual, she wished the rest of the barrel
      in his belly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, my dear, you are always much kinder than all the other women
      in the town for they all get wild if their husbands drink too much, but
      you&mdash;may God repay you&mdash;always wish that I may have a good
      draught that would last me all my days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know that I wish that," she said, "but I pray to God that you may
      drink such a lot some day that you may burst."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst they were conversing thus affectionately, the soup-kettle on the
      fire began to boil over, because the fire was too hot, and the good man,
      who noticed that his wife did not take it off the fire, said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you see, wife, that the pot is boiling over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still angry and indignant, and replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, master, I see it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then, take it off, confound you! Do as I bid you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will," she replied, "I will bid twelve pence." (*)
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (*) There is a pun in the French on the two meanings of the
     verb <i>hausser</i>,&mdash;"to raise" and to "augment" or "run up."
</pre>
    <p>
      "Oh, indeed, dame," said he, "is that your reply? Take off that pot, in
      God's name!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well!" she said. "I will put it at seven <i>sous</i>. Is that high
      enough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, ha!" he said. "By St. John that shall not pass without three blows
      with a good stick."
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up a thick stick, and laid it with all his might across her
      back, saying as he did so,
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lot is knocked down to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She began to cry, and the neighbours all assembled and asked what was the
      matter? The good man told them and they all laughed&mdash;except the woman
      who had had the lot knocked down to her.

    <h2>
      STORY THE NINETY-EIGHTH &mdash; THE UNFORTUNATE LOVERS.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By The Editor.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a knight of this kingdom and his wife, who had a fair daughter
        aged fifteen or sixteen. Her father would have married her to a rich old
        knight, his neighbour, but she ran away with another knight, a young man
        who loved her honourably; and, by strange mishap, they both died sad
        deaths without having ever co-habited,&mdash;as you will hear shortly.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the frontiers of France, there lived, amongst other nobles, a knight
      who was rich and noble, not only by illustrious descent, but by his own
      virtuous and honourable deeds, who had, by the wife he had married, an
      only daughter, a very beautiful virgin, well-educated as her condition
      required, and aged fifteen or sixteen years, or thereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This good and noble knight, seeing that his daughter was of a fit and
      proper age for the holy sacrament of wedlock, much wished to give her in
      marriage to a knight, his neighbour, who was powerful, not so much by
      noble birth as by great possessions and riches, and was also from 60 to 80
      years old, or thereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This wish so filled the head of the father of whom I spoke, that he would
      not rest until formal promises were made between him and his wife, the
      mother of the girl, and the aforesaid old knight, touching his marriage to
      the girl, who, for her part, knew and suspected nothing of all these
      arrangements, promises, and treaties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far from the castle of the knight, the father of this damsel, there
      lived another knight, a young man, valiant and brave, and moderately rich,
      but not so rich as the old man of whom I spoke, and this youth was greatly
      in love with the fair damsel. She also was much attached to him, on
      account of his fame and great renown, and they often spoke to each other,
      though with much trouble and difficulty, for her father, who suspected
      their love, tried by all ways and means to prevent their seeing each
      other. Nevertheless, he could not destroy the great and pure love which
      united their hearts, and when fortune favoured them with an opportunity,
      they discussed nothing but the means whereby they might accomplish their
      whole and sole desire and marry each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time approached when the damsel was to be given to the old knight, and
      her father told her of the contract he had made, and named the day on
      which she was to be married; at which she was greatly angered, but thought
      to herself that she might find a way out of the difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sent a message to her lover, the young knight, to tell him to come to
      her secretly as soon as he could; and when he came she told him how she
      was betrothed to the old knight, and asked her lover's advice as to how
      this marriage was to be broken off, for that she would never have any
      other man but him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knight replied,
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dearest lady, since of your kindness you offer me that which I should
      never have dared to ask without great shame, I thank you humbly, and if it
      be your will, I will tell you what we will do. We will appoint a day for
      me to come to this town accompanied by many of my friends, and at a given
      hour you will repair to a certain place, both of which we will arrange now
      that I am alone with you. You will mount on my horse, and I will conduct
      you to my castle. And then, if we can manage to pacify your father and
      mother, we will fulfil our promises of plighted troth."
    </p>
    <p>
      She replied that the plan was a good one, and she would carry it out
      properly. She told him that on such a day, at such an hour, he would find
      her at a certain place, and that she would do all that he had arranged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appointed day arrived, and the young knight appeared at the place
      mentioned, and there he found the lady, who mounted on his horse, and they
      rode fast until they were far from there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good knight, fearing that he should fatigue his dearly beloved
      mistress, slackened his speed, and spread his retainers on every road to
      see that they were not followed, and he rode across the fields, without
      keeping to any path or road, and as gently as he could, and charged his
      servants that they should meet at a large village which he named, and
      where he intended to stop and eat. This village was remote, and away from
      the high road.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode until they came to this village, where the local <i>fête</i> was
      being held, which had brought together all sorts of people. They entered
      the best tavern in the place, and at once demanded food and drink, for it
      was late after dinner, and the damsel was much fatigued. A good fire was
      made, and food prepared for the servants of the knight who had not yet
      arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly had the knight and the lady entered the tavern than there came four
      big swashbucklers&mdash;waggoners or drovers, or perhaps worse&mdash;who
      noisily entered the tavern, and demanded where was the <i>bona roba</i>
      that some ruffian had brought there, riding behind him on his horse, for
      they would drink with her, and amuse themselves with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host who knew the knight well, and was aware that the rascals spake
      not the truth, told them gently that the girl was not what they imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morbleu!" they replied; "if you do not bring her at once, we will batter
      down the door, and bring her by force in spite of the two of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the host heard this, and found that his explanation was no use, he
      named the knight, who was renowned through all that district, but unknown
      to many of the common people, because he had long been out of the country,
      acquiring honour and renown in wars in distant countries. The host told
      them also that the damsel was a young virgin, a relative of the knight,
      and of noble parentage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can, messieurs," he said, "without danger to yourself or others,
      quench your lust with many of the women who have come to the village on
      the occasion of the <i>fête</i> expressly for you and the like of you, and
      for God's sake leave in peace this noble damsel, and think of the great
      danger that you run, the evil that you wish to commit and the small hope
      that you have of success."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drop your sermons," shouted the rascals, inflamed with carnal lust, "and
      bring her to us quietly; or if not we will cause a scandal, for we will
      bring her down openly, and each of us four will do as he likes with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      These speeches being finished, the good host went up to the chamber where
      the knight and the damsel were, and called the knight apart, and told him
      this news, which when he had heard, without being troubled in the least,
      he went down wearing his sword, to talk to the four swashbucklers, and
      asked them politely what they wanted?
    </p>
    <p>
      And they, being foul-mouthed and abusive blackguards, replied that they
      wanted the <i>bona roba</i> that he kept shut up in his chamber, and that,
      if he did not give her up quietly, they would take her from him by force.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fair sirs," said the knight, "if you knew me well you would be aware that
      I should not take about women of that sort. I have never done such a
      folly, thank God. And even if I ever did&mdash;which God forbid&mdash;I
      should never do it in this district, where I and all my people are well
      known&mdash;my nobility and reputation would not suffer me to do it. This
      damsel is a young virgin, a near relative, related also to a noble house,
      and we are travelling for our pleasure, accompanied by my servants, who
      although they are not here at present, will come directly, and I am
      waiting for them. Moreover, do not flatter yourselves that I should be
      such a coward as to let her be insulted, or suffer injury of any kind; but
      I would protect and defend her as long as my strength endured, and until I
      died."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the knight had finished speaking, the villains interrupted him, and
      in the first place denied that he was the person he said, because he was
      alone, and that knight never travelled without a great number of servants.
      Therefore they recommended him, if he were wise, to bring the girl down,
      otherwise they would take her by force, whatever consequences might ensue.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this brave and valiant knight found that fair words were of no use,
      and that force was the only remedy, he summoned up all his courage, and
      resolved that the villains should not have the damsel, and that he was
      ready to die in her defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last one of the four advanced to knock with his bludgeon at the door of
      the chamber, and the others followed him, and were bravely beaten back by
      the knight. Then began a fight which lasted long, and although the two
      parties were so unequally matched, the good knight vanquished and repulsed
      the four villains, and as he pursued them to drive them away, one of them,
      who had a sword, turned suddenly and plunged it in the body of the knight,
      and pierced him through, so that he fell dead at once, at which they were
      very glad. Then they compelled the host to quietly bury the body in the
      garden of the inn.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the good knight was dead, the villains came and knocked at the door
      of the chamber where the damsel was impatiently awaiting the return of her
      lover, and they pushed open the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as she saw the brigands enter, she guessed that the knight was
      dead, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, where is my protector? Where is my sole refuge? What has become of
      him? Why does he thus wound my heart and leave me here alone?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The scoundrels, seeing that she was much troubled, thought to falsely
      deceive her by fair words, and told her the knight had gone to another
      house, and had commanded them to go to her and protect her; but she would
      not believe them, for her heart told her that they had killed him. She
      began to lament, and to cry more bitterly than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is this?" they said. "Why all these tricks and manners? Do you think
      we don't know you? If you imagine your bully is still alive, you are
      mistaken&mdash;we have rid the country of him. Therefore make your mind up
      that we are all four going to enjoy you." At these words one of them
      advanced, and seized her roughly, saying that he would have her company.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the poor damsel saw herself thus forced, and that she could not
      soften their hearts, she said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas! sirs, since you will force me, and my humble prayers cannot soften
      you, at least have this decency; that if I abandon myself to you it shall
      be privately, that is to say each separately without the presence of the
      others."
    </p>
    <p>
      They agreed to this, though with a bad grace, and then they made her
      choose which of the four should first have her company. She chose the one
      that she fancied was the mildest and best-tempered, but he was the worst
      of all. The door was closed, and then the poor damsel threw herself at the
      scoundrel's feet, and with many piteous appeals, begged that he would have
      pity on her. But he was obstinate, and declared that he would have his
      will of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw that he was so cruel, and that her prayers could not melt
      him, she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well then, since so it must be, I am content; but I beg of you to close
      the windows that we may be more secret."
    </p>
    <p>
      He willingly consented, and whilst he was closing them, she drew a little
      knife that she wore at her girdle, and uttering one long, piteous cry, she
      cut her throat, and gave up the ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the scoundrel saw her lying on the ground, he fled along with his
      companions, and it is to be supposed that they were afterwards punished
      according to their deserts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus did these two sweet lovers end their days, one directly after the
      other, without ever having tasted of the joys and pleasures in which they
      hoped to have lived together all their days.

      <p>
        <i>Relates how a Spanish Bishop, not being able to procure fish, ate two
        partridges on a Friday, and how he told his servants that he had
        converted them by his prayers into fish&mdash;as will more plainly be
        related below.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      If you wish, you shall hear now, before it is too late, a little story
      about a brave Spanish Bishop who went to Rome to transact some business
      for his master the King of Castille.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brave prelate, whom I intend to make furnish this last story, arrived
      one day at a little village in Lombardy, it being then early on a Friday
      evening, and ordered his steward to have supper early, and to go into the
      town and buy what he could, for he (the Bishop) was very hungry, not
      having broken his fast all that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      His servant obeyed him, and went to the market, and to all the fishmongers
      in the town, to procure some fish, but, to make the story short, not a
      single fish, in spite of all the efforts made by the steward, could be
      found.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, on returning to the inn, he met a countryman, who had two fine
      partridges which he would sell very cheaply. The steward thought he would
      secure them, and they would serve to make the Bishop a feast on Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bought them, a great bargain, and came to his master with the two
      partridges in his hand, all alive, and fat, and plump, and told him of his
      failure to get any fish, at which my Lord was not best pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what can we have for supper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Lord," replied the steward, "I will get them to prepare you eggs in a
      hundred thousand different ways, and you can have apples and pears. Our
      host has also some rich cheese. We will do our best; have patience, a
      supper is soon over, and you shall fare better to-morrow, God willing. We
      shall be in a town which is much better provided with fish than this, and
      on Sunday you cannot fail to dine well, for here are two partridges which
      are plump and succulent."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop looked at the two partridges, and found them as the steward
      said, plump, and in good condition, so he thought they would take the
      place of the fish which he had lost. So he caused them to be killed and
      prepared for the spit.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the steward saw that his master wished to have them roasted, he was
      astounded, and said to his master;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, it is well to kill them, but to roast them now for Sunday seems
      a pity."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the steward lost his time, for, in spite of his remonstrances, they
      were put on the spit and roasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good prelate watched them cooking, and the poor steward was
      scandalized, and did not know what to make of his master's ill-ordered
      appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the partridges were roasted, the table laid, the wine brought in,
      eggs cooked in various ways, and served to a turn, the prelate seated
      himself, said grace, and asked for the partridges, with mustard.
    </p>
    <p>
      His steward wished to know what his master would do with these birds, and
      brought them to him fresh from the fire, and emitting an odour enough to
      make a friar's mouth water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good Bishop attacked the partridges, and began to cut and eat with
      such haste, that he did not give his squire, who came to carve for him,
      sufficient time to lay his bread, and sharpen his knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the steward saw his master eating the birds, he was so amazed that he
      could no longer keep silent, and said to him;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my lord, what are you doing? Are you a Jew or a Saracen, that you do
      not keep Friday? By my faith, I am astonished at such doings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold your tongue! Hold your tongue!" said the good prelate, who had his
      hands and his beard covered with fat and gravy. "You are a fool, and know
      not what you are saying. I am doing no harm. You know well and believe,
      that by the words spoken by me and other priests, we make of the host,
      which is nothing but flour and water, the precious body of Jesus Christ.
      Can I not by the same means?&mdash;I who have seen so many things at the
      court of Rome and many other places&mdash;know by what words I may
      transform these partridges, which are flesh, into fish, although they
      still retain the form of partridges? So indeed I have done. I have long
      known how to do this. They were no sooner put to the fire than by certain
      words I know, I so charmed them that I converted them into the substance
      of fish, and you might&mdash;all of you who are here&mdash;eat, as I do,
      without sin. But as you would still believe them to be flesh, they would
      do you harm, so I alone will commit the sin."
    </p>
    <p>
      The steward and the other attendants began to laugh, and pretended to
      believe the highly-coloured story that their master had told them, and
      ever after that were up to the trick, and related it joyously in many
      places.

      STORY THE HUNDREDTH AND LAST &mdash; THE CHASTE LOVER.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      By Philippe De Laon.
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <i>Of a rich merchant of the city of Genoa, who married a fair damsel,
        who owing to the absence of her husband, sent for a wise clerk&mdash;a
        young, fit, and proper man&mdash;to help her to that of which she had
        need; and of the fast that he caused her to make&mdash;as you will find
        more plainly below.</i>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In the powerful and well-populated city of Genoa, there, lived some time
      ago, a merchant who was very rich, and whose business consisted in sending
      much merchandise by sea to foreign lands, and especially to Alexandria. So
      occupied was he with the management of his ships, and in heaping up
      riches, that during all his days, from his tender youth till the time that
      he was fifty years of age, he never cared or wanted to do anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had arrived at this last mentioned age, he began to think about
      his condition, and to see that he had spent and employed all his days and
      years in heaping up riches without ever having for a single minute or
      moment been inclined to think of marrying and having children, to whom the
      great wealth, that he had by great diligence and labour amassed and
      acquired, would succeed. This thought caused him much mental sorrow, and
      he was greatly vexed that he had thus spent his youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      This grief and regret lasted many days, during which time it happened that
      in the above-named city, the young children, after they had solemnized
      some festival, did as they were accustomed each year, and variously
      apparelled and disguised, some this way and some that, came in great
      numbers to the place where the public rejoicings of the city are usually
      held, to play in the presence of their fathers and mothers, and to have
      their costumes praised and admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this assembly was our merchant, still moody and vexed, and the sight of
      so many fathers and mothers taking pleasure in watching their children
      dance and sport, increased the grief that was preying on his mind, and,
      unable to watch them any longer, he returned to his house, sad and vexed,
      and retired to his lonely chamber, where he remained some time, uttering
      complaints of this kind;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, poor, miserable, old man that I am and always have been, and for whom
      fate and destiny are hard, bitter, and unpleasant. Oh, wretched man! worn
      out and weary by watching and work, suffered and borne by land and sea.
      Your great riches and heaped-up treasures, which with many perilous
      adventures, hard work, and sweat you have amassed, and for which you have
      expended all your time, are but vain, for you have never thought who will
      possess them, and to whom by human law you should leave your memory and
      your name when you are dead and gone. Oh, wicked man, how could you have
      been careless of that of which you should have taken most heed? Marriage
      never pleased you, and you always feared and refused it, and even disliked
      and scorned the good and just counsels of those who would have found you a
      wife, in order that you might have offspring who would perpetuate your
      name, your praise, and your renown. Oh, how happy are those parents who
      leave good and wise children to succeed them! How many fathers have I seen
      to-day playing with their children, who would call themselves most happy,
      and think they had well employed their time, if, after their decease, they
      could leave their children but one small part of the great wealth that I
      possess! But what pleasure and solace can I ever have? What name or fame
      shall I leave after my death? Where is the son who will cherish my memory
      when I am dead? Blessed be that holy condition of marriage by which the
      memory and recollection of fathers is preserved, and by which fiefs,
      possessions, and heritages are permanently secured to their happy
      children!"
    </p>
    <p>
      When the good merchant had thus argued to himself for a long time, he
      suddenly thought of a remedy for his misfortunes, saying;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I am in future determined, notwithstanding the number of my years,
      not to trouble or torment myself with grief, or remorse. At the worst I
      have but been like the birds, which prepare their nests before they begin
      to lay their eggs. I have, thank God, riches sufficient for myself, wife,
      and many children, if it should happen that I have any, nor am I so old,
      or so devoid of natural vigour, as to lose hope of even having any
      offspring. What I have to do is to watch and work, and use every endeavour
      to discover where I shall find a wife fit and proper for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having finished his soliloquy, he left his chamber, and sent for two of
      his comrades&mdash;merchant-mariners like himself,&mdash;and to them he
      plainly stated his case, and requested them to help to find him a wife,
      for that was the thing he most desired in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two merchants, having heard what their comrade had to say, much
      applauded his determination, and undertook to make all possible endeavours
      to find him a wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst they were making enquiries, our merchant,&mdash;as hot to get
      married as he could be&mdash;played the gallant, and sought throughout the
      city all the youngest and prettiest girls&mdash;to the others he paid
      small heed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He searched so well that he found one such as he required,&mdash;born of
      honest parents, marvellously beautiful, aged only fifteen or thereabouts,
      gentle, good-tempered, and well brought up in every respect.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he knew her virtues and good qualities, he felt such affection
      and desire that she should be his lawful wife, that he asked her hand of
      her parents and friends; which, after some slight difficulties that were
      quickly removed, was given, and the same hour they were betrothed, and
      security given by him for the dower he was to bestow upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the good merchant had taken pride and pleasure in his merchandise
      during the time that he was amassing a fortune, he felt still more when he
      saw himself certain of being married, and that to a wife by whom he could
      have fine children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding was honourably celebrated, with all due pomp, and that feast
      being over and finished, he forgot all about his former life,&mdash;that
      is to say on the sea&mdash;but lived happily and in great pleasure with
      his fair and fond wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this way of life did not last long, for he soon became tired and
      bored, and before the first year had expired took a dislike to living at
      home in idleness and a humdrum domestic existence, and pined for his old
      business of merchant-mariner, which seemed to him easier and more pleasant
      than that which he had so willingly undertaken to manage night and day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did nothing but devise how he could get to Alexandria, as he used in
      the old days, and it seemed to him that it was not only difficult but
      impossible for him to abstain from going to sea. Yet though he firmly
      resolved to return to his old profession, he concealed his intention from
      his wife, fearing that she might be displeased.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were also fears and doubts which disturbed him, and prevented him
      from executing his designs, for he knew the youth and character of his
      wife, and he felt sure that if he were absent she would not be able to
      control herself; and he considered also the mutability and variability of
      the feminine character, and that the young gallants were accustomed to
      pass in front of his house to see his wife, even when he was at home,&mdash;whence
      he imagined that in his absence they might come closer, and peradventure
      even take his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time he was tormented by these difficulties and suspicions
      without saying a word but as he knew that he had lived the best part of
      his life, he now cared little for wife, marriage, and all that concerned
      domestic life, and to the arguments and theories which filled his head,
      provided a speedy solution by saying;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is better to live than to die, and, if I do not quit my household very
      shortly, it is very certain that I shall not live. But then, shall I leave
      my fair and affectionate wife? Yes, I will leave her;&mdash;she shall
      henceforth manage for herself as she pleases; it will no longer be
      incumbent on me. Alas, what shall I do? What a dishonour, what an
      annoyance it would be for me if she did not continue to guard her
      chastity. Ah, yes, it is better to live than to die, that I may be able to
      look after her! But God cannot wish that I should take such care and pains
      about a woman's belly without any pay or reward, and receive nothing in
      return but torture of soul and body. I will not bear all the trouble and
      anguish of mind that many suffer in living with their wives. It angers me
      and saddens me to think that God only permits me to live to enjoy the
      trifling incidents of married life. I want full liberty and freedom to do
      what I please."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the good merchant had finished these sage reflections, he went and
      found some of his old comrades, and told them that he wished to visit
      Alexandria with a cargo of merchandise, as he had often previously done in
      their company,&mdash;but he did not tell them of the trouble and anxiety
      which his married life caused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He soon made all arrangements with them, and they told him to be ready to
      start when the first fair wind came. The sailors and cargo were soon
      ready, and awaited in a safe place, a fair wind to start.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good merchant, still firm in his determination, as on the previous
      days, found his wife alone in her chamber, and that she should not be sad
      at his departure, addressed her in these words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dearest wife, whom I love better than my life, I beg of you to be of
      good heart, and show yourself joyful, and be not sad or cast down at what
      I am about to say to you. I propose&mdash;if it be God's pleasure&mdash;to
      once more visit Alexandria, as I have long been in the habit of doing; and
      it seems to me that you should not be vexed thereat, seeing that you are
      aware that that is my business and profession, by which I have acquired
      riches, houses, name, and fame, and many good friends. The handsome and
      rich ornaments, rings, garments, and other things with which you are
      apparelled and ornamented as is no other woman in the city, as you well
      know, I have acquired by the profit I have made on my merchandise. This
      journey of mine therefore should not trouble you, for I shall shortly
      return. And I promise you that if this time,&mdash;as I hope,&mdash;Fortune
      should smile upon me, never will I return there again, but this time will
      take leave of it for ever. You must therefore be of good courage, and I
      will leave in your hands the disposition, administration, and management
      of all the goods which I possess; but before I leave I have some requests
      to make of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The first is, I beg of you to be happy whilst I am on my voyage, and live
      comfortably; for if I know that such is the case I shall have greater
      pleasure in my voyage. For the second, you know that nothing should be
      hidden or concealed between us two, and all honour, profit, and renown
      should be&mdash;as I know they are&mdash;common to both of us, and the
      praise and honour of the one cannot exist without the glory of the other,
      and similarly the dishonour of the one would be the shame of us both. I
      wish you to understand that I am not so devoid of sense that I am not
      aware that I leave you young, beautiful, kind, fresh, and tender, and
      without the consolation of a husband; and that many men will desire you.
      And although I firmly believe that you are now fully resolved,
      nevertheless, when I think of your age and inclinations and the warmth of
      your desires, it does not seem possible to me that you should not, out of
      pure necessity and compulsion, enjoy the company of a man during my
      absence. It is my will and pleasure therefore to permit you to grant those
      favours which nature compels you to grant. I would beg of you though to
      respect our marriage vow unbroken as long as you possibly can. I neither
      intend nor wish to leave you in the charge of any person, but leave you to
      be your own guardian. Truly, there is no duenna, however watchful, who can
      prevent a woman from doing what she wishes. When therefore your desires
      shall prick and spur you on, I would beg you, my dear wife, to act with
      such circumspection in their execution that they may not be publicly
      known,&mdash;for if you do otherwise, you, and I, and all our friends will
      be infamous and dishonoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If then you cannot remain chaste, at least take pains to retain your
      reputation. I will teach you how that is to be done, if the need should
      arise. You know that in our good city there are plenty of handsome men.
      From amongst these choose one only, and be content to do with him whatever
      nature may incline you to do. At all events, I wish that in making your
      choice you should take particular care that he is not a vagabond, or
      dishonest, or disreputable person, for great dangers might arise from your
      acquaintance with such a person, inasmuch as he would, without doubt
      publish your secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will select one therefore who is, you are sure, both wise and
      prudent, and who will take as much pains to conceal your amour as you do
      yourself. This I beg of you, and that you will promise me honestly and
      loyally to remember this lesson. I do not advise you to reply in the way
      that other women are accustomed to when similar proposals are made to
      them. I know what they would say, which would be somewhat to this effect.
      'Oh, husband! what do you mean by speaking like that? How could you have
      such a cruel, unjust opinion of me? How can you imagine that I should
      commit such an abominable crime? No! no! God forbid that I should make you
      such a promise. I will rather wish that the earth may open and swallow me
      up alive the day and hour&mdash;I will not say commit&mdash;but even think
      of committing such a sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear wife, I have shown you this way of replying in order that you may
      not use the same to me. I firmly and truly believe that at the present
      moment you are fully determined to remain chaste, and I desire you to
      remain of that opinion as long as nature will permit you. And understand
      that I do not wish you to break your vows unless you are unable to battle
      against the appetites of your frail and weak youth."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the good merchant had finished his speech, his fair, kind, and gentle
      wife, her face all suffused with blushes, trembled, and could not for some
      moments reply to what her husband had said. Soon her blushes vanished, her
      confidence returned, and calling up all her courage, she replied in these
      words;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My kind, and greatly beloved husband, I assure you that never have I been
      so disturbed and troubled by any speech I have ever heard, as I am now by
      your words, by which I learn something that I never heard or guessed. You
      know my simplicity, youth, and innocence, and you say that it is not
      possible at my age to avoid committing such a fault, and that you are sure
      and know positively that when you are away I shall not be able to preserve
      our marriage vow in its integrity. That speech greatly vexed my heart, and
      made me tremble, and I do not know how I can reply to your arguments. You
      have deprived me of the reply I should have made, but I can tell you from
      the bottom of my heart that with joined hands I beg most humbly of God
      that he may cause an abyss to open in which I may be thrown, that my limbs
      may be torn off, and that I may suffer a most cruel death, if ever the day
      comes when I shall not only be disloyal to our marriage vow, but even
      think for a brief moment of being disloyal. How, and in what manner I
      could be brought to commit such a crime, I am unable to comprehend. And as
      you have forbidden me to reply as I should, telling me that women are
      accustomed to make elusive and false excuses, I will to give you pleasure,
      and allay your suspicions, and that you may see that I am ready to obey
      and keep your commands, promise you this moment with firm and immutable
      faith and constancy, to await the day of your return in true, pure, and
      entire chastity of body, and may God forbid that the contrary should
      happen. Be fully assured that I will obey your orders in every respect. If
      there is anything else you wish or command, I beg of you to inform me, and
      I will perform your will (I desire nothing else) and not my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our merchant, when he heard his wife's reply, was so overjoyed that he
      could not refrain from weeping, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dearest spouse, since you have of your great kindness given me the
      promise that I required, I beg of you to keep it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The following morning, the good merchant was sent for by his comrades to
      put to sea. So he took leave of his wife, and commended her to the care of
      God. Then he put to sea to sail to Alexandria where they arrived in a few
      days, the wind being favourable, at which place they stayed a long time
      both to deliver their merchandise and take in fresh cargoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this time the gracious damsel of whom I have spoken remained in the
      house with, as her only companion, a little girl who served her. As I have
      said, this fair damsel was but fifteen years of age, therefore any fault
      that she committed must be imputed, not to a vicious character, but to
      youth and inexperience.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the merchant had been absent many days, little by little she began to
      forget him. As soon as the young men of the city knew of his departure,
      they came to visit her. At first she would neither leave the house nor
      show herself, but as they continued to come daily, she, on account of the
      great pleasure she took in sweet and melodious songs and harmonies of all
      instruments, which they played outside her door, peeped through the
      crevices of the windows and the trellis so that she could see the
      musicians, and they for their part were quite willing to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In hearing these songs and dances she took so much pleasure, that her mind
      was filled with love, and the natural warmth of her affections often
      tempted her to incontinence. So often was she visited in this manner, that
      in the end her concupiscence and carnal desires conquered, and she was
      fairly hit by the dart of love. She often thought how easy it was for her
      to find time and place for any lover, for no one guarded her, and no one
      could prevent her putting her designs in execution, and she came to the
      conclusion that her husband was very wise when he said he was positive
      that she could not preserve continence and chastity, although she wished
      to keep the promise she had made to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is right then," she said to herself, "for me to follow my husband's
      advice; by doing which I shall incur no dishonour, since he himself gave
      me permission, and I shall not violate the promise I made him. I remember
      rightly that he charged me that if ever I broke my vow of chastity, that I
      should choose a man who was wise, of good fame, and great virtues, and no
      other. That is what I will really do, as I may without disobeying my
      husband's instructions, and by following his good advice which was ample
      for my purpose. I suppose that he did not intend that the man should be
      old, and it seems to me that he should be young, but having as good a
      reputation for learning and science as any old man. Such was my husband's
      advice, I remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time that the damsel was making these reflections, and was
      searching for a wise and prudent, young man to cool her bowels, there
      fortunately arrived in the city a very wise young clerk, who had newly
      arrived from the university of Bologna, where he had been several years
      without once returning to his native city. Such attention had he given to
      his studies that there was not in all the country a clerk who enjoyed such
      a reputation amongst the learned men of the city, whom he assisted
      continually.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was accustomed to go every day to the Town Hall on the market-place,
      and was obliged to pass before the house of the said damsel, who was much
      struck by his appearance and pleasant manners. And although he had never
      filled any clerical office, she came to the conclusion that he was a very
      learned clerk, and fell deeply in love with him, saying to herself that he
      would be the man to guard her husband's secret; but how she was to inform
      him of her great and ardent love, and reveal the secret desires of her
      mind she knew not,&mdash;at which she was much vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She bethought herself that as every day he passed before her house on his
      way to the market place, that she would be upon her balcony, dressed as
      handsomely as possible, in order that when he passed he might notice her
      beauty, and so be led to desire those favours which would not be refused
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many times did the damsel so show herself, although that had not
      previously been her custom, and though she was pleasant to gaze upon, and
      her youthful mind was filled with thoughts of love, the wise clerk never
      perceived her, for in walking he glanced neither to the right nor left.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plan of the damsel's was not as successful as she imagined it would
      be. She was very sorrowful, and the more she thought of the clerk, the
      more ardent did her desires become. At last, after a number of plans had
      suggested themselves to her, and which for the sake of brevity I pass
      over, she determined to send her little servant-maid to him. So she called
      her, and ordered her to go and ask for such-an-one,&mdash;that is to say,
      the learned clerk&mdash;and when she had found him, to tell him to come in
      haste to the house of such a damsel, the wife of so-and-so; and if he
      should ask what the damsel wanted, she was to reply that she knew not, but
      only knew that he was urgently required to come at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl learned her message, and went forth to seek him; and she
      was soon shown a house where he was at dinner with a great company of his
      friends, and other people of high degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl entered the house, and saluting all the company, asked for the
      clerk, and delivered her message properly. The good clerk, who had been
      acquainted since his youth with the merchant of whom the girl spoke, and
      knew his house as he did his own, but was not aware that he was married or
      who was his wife, imagined that during the husband's absence, the wife had
      need of advice on some weighty matter, for he knew that the husband was
      away, and had no suspicion of the cause of his invitation. He said to the
      girl;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, go and tell your mistress that as soon as dinner is over I will
      come to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      The messenger duly delivered these words, and God knows how she was
      received by her mistress. When she heard that the clerk, her lover, would
      come, she was more joyful than ever woman was, and owing to the great joy
      she felt at having the clerk in the house, she trembled and did not know
      what to do. She caused the house to be well swept, and fair herbage to be
      spread in her chamber, covered the bed and the couch with rich tapestry
      and embroidery, and dressed and adorned herself with her most precious
      belongings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she waited a little time, which seemed to her marvellous long on
      account of the great desire she had, and so impatient was she for his
      arrival, and that she might perceive him coming afar off, she went up to
      her chamber and then came down again, and went now hither, now thither,
      and was so excited that it seemed as though she were out of her senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she went up to her chamber, and there laid out all the riches and
      delicacies that she had prepared to feast her lover. She made the little
      servant-maid stay below to let the clerk in, and conduct him to her
      mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he arrived, the servant-maid received him, and let him in and closed
      the door, leaving his servants outside, whom she told that they were to
      await their master's return.
    </p>
    <p>
      The damsel, hearing that her lover had arrived, could not refrain from
      running down stairs to meet him, and she saluted him politely. Then she
      took his hand and led him to the chamber which she had prepared. He was
      much astonished when he arrived there, not only by the diversity of
      splendours that he saw, but also by the great beauty of the fair girl who
      conducted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they were in the chamber, she sat down on a stool by the couch,
      and made him sit on another by her side, and there they both sat for a
      certain time, without saying a word, for each waited for the other to
      speak, though in very different ways, for the clerk imagined that the
      damsel would consult him on some great and difficult matter, and wished
      her to begin; whilst she, on the other hand, knowing how wise and prudent
      he was, believed that he would know why he had been sent for without her
      telling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw that he made no attempt to speak, she began, and said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My very dear and true friend, and learned man, I will tell you at once
      why I have sent for you. I believe that you are well-acquainted and
      familiar with my husband. He has left me, in the condition you now see me,
      whilst he goes to Alexandria to bring back merchandise, as he has long
      been used. Before his departure, he told me that when he was away, he was
      sure that my weak and fragile nature would cause me to lose my chastity,
      and that necessity would compel me to have intercourse with a man to
      quench the natural longings I should be sure to feel after his departure.
      And truly I deem him a very wise man, for that which I thought impossible
      I find has happened, for my youth, beauty, and nature rebel against
      wasting away in vain. That you may understand me plainly I will tell you
      that my wise and thoughtful husband when he left, knew that as all young
      and tender plants dry and wither when they cannot fulfil the needs of
      their nature, so it was likely to be with me. And seeing clearly that my
      nature and constitution were likely to be controlled by my natural
      desires, which I could not long resist, he made me swear and promise that,
      if nature should force me to become unchaste, I would choose a wise man of
      good position, who would carefully guard our secret. I do not think there
      is in all the city a man more worthy than yourself, for you are young and
      very wise. I do not suppose then that you will refuse me or repel me. You
      see me as I am, and you may, during the absence of my husband, supply his
      place if you wish, and without the knowledge of any one; place, time, and
      opportunity all favour us."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman was much surprised and moved at what the lady said, but he
      concealed his emotion. He took her right hand and with a smiling face
      addressed her in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to render infinite thanks to Dame Fortune, who has to-day given
      me so much pleasure, and the attainment of the greatest happiness I could
      have in this world; never in my life will I call myself unfortunate, since
      Fortune has granted me this great favour. I may certainly say that I am
      to-day the happiest of men, for when I consider, my beautiful and kind
      mistress, how we may joyously pass our days together, without any person's
      knowledge or interference, I almost faint with joy. Where is the man more
      favoured by Fortune than I am? If it were not for one thing which forms a
      slight obstacle to our love affair, I should be the luckiest man on earth,
      and I am greatly vexed and annoyed that I cannot overcome that
      difficulty."
    </p>
    <p>
      When the damsel, who had never imagined that any difficulty could arise,
      heard that there was an obstacle which would prevent her indulging her
      passions, she was very sad and sorrowful, and begged him to say what it
      was, in order that she might find a remedy if possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The obstacle," he said, "is not so great that it cannot be removed in a
      little time, and, since you are kind enough to wish to know what it is, I
      will tell you. When I was studying at the University of Bologna, the
      people of the city rose in insurrection against their ruler. I was
      accused, along with some others, my companions, of having stirred up this
      insurrection, and I was closely imprisoned. When I found myself in prison,
      and in danger of losing my life, though I knew I was innocent, I made a
      vow to God, promising that if He would deliver me from prison and restore
      me to my friends and relations in this city, I would, for love of Him,
      fast for a whole year on bread and water, and during that fast would not
      allow my body to sin. Now I have, by His aid, accomplished the greater
      part of the year and but little remains. I would beg of you therefore,
      since it is your pleasure to choose me as your lover, not to change again
      for any man in the world, and not to fret over the little delay that is
      necessary for me to accomplish my fast, and which is now but a very short
      time, and would have been long since over if I had dared to confide in
      some one else who could help me, for any days that others will fast for me
      are counted as though I fasted myself. And as I perceive the great love
      and confidence you have for me, I will, if you wish, place a trust in you
      that I have never put in my brothers, nor my friends, nor relations. I
      will ask you to help me with the remaining part of the fast to accomplish
      the year, that I may the sooner aid you in the matter you have desired of
      me. My kind friend, I have but sixty days to fast, which&mdash;if it is
      your will and pleasure&mdash;I will divide in two parts, of which you
      shall have one and I will have the other, on condition that you promise to
      perform your part honestly and without fraud, and when all is completed,
      we will pass our days pleasantly. If therefore, you are willing to help me
      in the manner I have said, tell me at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to be supposed that this long delay was hardly pleasing to the young
      woman, but as her lover had asked her so kindly, and also because she
      wished the fast to be finished, that she might accomplish her desires with
      her lover, and thinking also that thirty days would not much interfere
      with her intentions, she promised to perform her share without fraud,
      deception, or imposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      The good gentleman, seeing that he had won his case and that his affairs
      were prospering, took leave of the damsel, (who suspected no harm) and
      told her that as it was on his road from his home to the market-place to
      pass by her house, he would, without fail, often come and visit her, and
      so he departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair damsel began the next day her fast, making a rule for herself
      that during all the time of the fast she would eat nothing but bread and
      water until the sun had set.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had fasted three days, the wise clerk, as he was going to the
      market-place at the accustomed time, called upon the lady, with whom he
      talked long, and then, as he was saying farewell, asked her if she had
      commenced the fast? She replied she had.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you continue," he said, "and keep your promise until all is
      finished?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can entirely," she replied; "do not fear."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took leave and departed, and she went on from day to day with her fast,
      and kept her vow as she had promised, such being her good-nature. Before
      she had fasted eight days, her natural heat began to decrease so much that
      she was forced to change her clothes and put on furs and thick garments,
      which are usually only worn in winter, instead of the light robes which
      she wore before she began the fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the fifteenth day, she received a visit from her lover, who found her
      so weak that she could hardly move about the house, but the poor simpleton
      was firmly resolved not to practise any trickery, so deeply in love was
      she, and so firmly resolved to persevere with this fast, for the sake of
      the joys and pleasant delights which awaited her at the termination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk, when he entered the house, and saw her so feeble, said;
    </p>
    <p>
      "What kind of face is that, and how is your health? Now I see that you are
      sorry you undertook this long fast! Ah, my sweetest love! have a firm and
      constant mind. We have to-day achieved the half of our task: if your
      nature is weak, conquer it by firmness and constancy of heart, and do not
      break your faithful promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      He admonished her so kindly, that she took courage, so that it seemed to
      her that the remaining fifteen days would hardly be noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twentieth came, and the poor simpleton had lost all colour and seemed
      half dead, and felt no more desires of concupiscence than if she had been
      really dead. She was obliged to take to her bed and continually remain
      there, and then, it occurred to her mind that the clerk had caused her to
      fast to punish her carnal appetites, and she came to the conclusion that
      his methods were ingenious and effective, and would not have been thought
      of by a less clever and good man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, she was not less resolved to go on to the ead, and
      thoroughly fulfil her promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the last day but one of the fast, she sent for the clerk, who, when he
      saw her in bed asked her if she had lost courage now that there was only
      one day more to run?
    </p>
    <p>
      But she, interrupting him, replied;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, my good friend, you loved me with a true and perfect love, and not
      dishonourably, as I dared to love you. Therefore I shall esteem you, as
      long as God gives life to me and to you, as my dearest and best friend,
      who protected, and taught me to protect, my chastity, and the honour and
      good name, of me, my husband, my relatives, and my friends. Blessed also
      be my dear husband, whose advice and counsels I have kept, to the great
      solace of my heart. But for you, my friend, I render you such thanks as I
      may, for your honourable conduct and your great kindness to me, for which
      I can never sufficiently requite you, nor can my friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      The good and wise clerk, seeing that he had achieved his object, took
      leave of the fair damsel, and gently admonished her and advised her that
      she should in future correct her body by abstinence and fasting whenever
      she felt any prickings of lust. By which means she lived chastely until
      the return of her husband, who knew nothing of the matter, for she
      concealed it from him&mdash;and so also did the clerk.

      Brantôme, in <i>Les Dames Galantes</i>, records that, "Louis, Duc
      d'Orléans was a great seducer of Court ladies, and always the greatest. A
      beautiful and noble lady was sleeping with him when her husband came into
      the chamber to wish the Duke good-day. The Duke covered the lady's head
      with the sheet, and uncovered the rest of her body, and allowed the
      husband to look and touch as much as he liked, but forbade him, as he
      valued his life, to uncover her head&mdash;And the best of it was, that
      the next night, the husband being in bed with his wife told her that the
      Duke had shown him the most beautiful naked woman that ever he saw, but as
      to her face he could not report, being forbidden to see it. I leave you to
      imagine what his wife thought!" The lady was,&mdash;scandal averred&mdash;Mariette
      d'Enghien, the mother of the brave and handsome Comte de Dunois, known in
      French history as "the bastard of Orléans." In the M. S. discovered by Mr.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
