INTRODUCTION
</a><br />



<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0003">STORY THE FIRST &mdash; THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL.</a>
<br>
<i>The first story tells of how one found means to enjoy the wife of his
<br>
neighbour, whose husband he had sent away in order that he might have
<br>
her the more easily, and how the husband returning from his journey,
<br>
found his friend bathing with his wife. And not knowing who she was, he
<br>
wished to see her, but was permitted only to see her back&mdash;, and then
<br>
thought that she resembled his wife, but dared not believe it. And
<br>
thereupon left and found his wife at home, she having escaped by a
<br>
postern door, and related to her his suspicions.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0004">STORY THE SECOND &mdash; THE MONK-DOCTOR.</a>
<br>
<i>The second story, related by Duke Philip, is of a young girl who had
<br>
piles, who put out the only eye he had of a Cordelier monk who was
<br>
healing her, and of the lawsuit that followed thereon.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0005">STORY THE THIRD &mdash; THE SEARCH FOR THE RING.</a>
<br>
<i>Of the deceit practised by a knight on a miller's wife whom he made
<br>
believe that her front was loose, and fastened it many times. And the
<br>
miller informed of this, searched for a diamond that the knight's lady
<br>
had lost, and found it in her body, as the knight knew afterwards: so he
<br>
called the miller "fisherman", and the miller called him "fastener".</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0006">STORY THE FOURTH &mdash; THE ARMED CUCKOLD.</a>
<br>
<i>The fourth tale is of a Scotch archer who was in love with a fair
<br>
and gentle dame, the wife of a mercer, who, by her husband's orders
<br>
appointed a day for the said Scot to visit her, who came and treated her
<br>
as he wished, the said mercer being hid by the side of the bed, where he
<br>
could see and hear all.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0007">STORY THE FIFTH &mdash; The Duel with the Buckle-Strap.</a>
<br>
<i>The fifth story relates two judgments of Lord Talbot. How a Frenchman
<br>
was taken prisoner (though provided with a safe-conduct) by an
<br>
Englishman, who said that buckle-straps were implements of war, and who
<br>
was made to arm himself with buckle-straps and nothing else, and meet
<br>
the Frenchman, who struck him with a sword in the presence of Talbot.
<br>
The other, story is about a man who robbed a church, and who was made to
<br>
swear that he would never enter a church again.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0008">STORY THE SIXTH &mdash;THE DRUNKARD IN PARADISE.</a>
<br>
<i>The sixth story is of a drunkard, who would confess to the Prior of the
<br>
Augustines at the Hague, and after his confession said that he was then
<br>
in a holy state and would die; and believed that his head was cut off
<br>
and that he was dead, and was carried away by his companions who said
<br>
they were going to bury him.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0009">STORY THE SEVENTH &mdash; THE WAGGONER IN THE BEAR.</a>
<br>
<i>Of a goldsmith of Paris who made a waggoner sleep with him and his
<br>
wife, and how the waggoner dallied with her from behind, which the
<br>
goldsmith perceived and discovered, and of the words which he spake to
<br>
the waggoner.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0010">STORY THE EIGHTH &mdash; TIT FOR TAT.</a>
<br>
<i>Of a youth of Picardy who lived at Brussels, and made his master's
<br>
daughter pregnant, and for that cause left and came back to Picardy to
<br>
be married. And soon after his departure the girl's mother perceived the
<br>
condition of her daughter, and the girl confessed in what state she was;
<br>
so her mother sent her to the Picardian to tell him that he must undo
<br>
that which he had done. And how his new bride refused then to sleep with
<br>
him, and of the story she told him, whereupon he immediately left her
<br>
and returned to his first love, and married her.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0011">STORY THE NINTH &mdash; THE HUSBAND PANDAR TO HIS OWN WIFE.</a>
<br>
<i>Of a knight of Burgundy, who was marvellously amorous of one of his
<br>
wife's waiting women, and thinking to sleep with her, slept with his
<br>
wife who was in the bed of the said tire-woman. And how he caused, by
<br>
his order, another knight, his neighbour to sleep with the said woman,
<br>
believing that it was really the tirewoman&mdash;and afterwards he was not
<br>
well pleased, albeit that the lady knew nothing, and was not aware, I
<br>
believe, that she had had to do with aught other than her own husband.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0012">STORY THE TENTH &mdash; THE EEL PASTIES.</a>
<br>
<i>Of a knight of England, who, after he was married, wished his mignon to
<br>
procuré him some pretty girls, as he did before; which the mignon would
<br>
not do, saying that one wife sufficed; but the said knight brought him
<br>
back to obedience by causing eel pasties to be always served to him,
<br>
both at dinner and at supper.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0013">STORY THE ELEVENTH &mdash; A SACRIFICE TO THE DEVIL.</a>
<br>
<i>Of a jealous rogue, who after many offerings made to divers saints to
<br>
curé him of his jealousy, offered a candle to the devil who is usually
<br>
painted under the feet of St. Michael; and of the dream that he had and
<br>
what happened to him when he awoke.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0014">STORY THE TWELFTH &mdash; THE CALF.</a>
<br>
<i>Of a Dutchman, who at all hours of the day and night ceased not to
<br>
dally with his wife in love sports; and how it chanced that he laid her
<br>
down, as they went through a wood, under a great tree in which was a
<br>
labourer who had lost his calf. And as he was enumerating the charms of
<br>
his wife, and naming all the pretty things he could see, the labourer
<br>
asked him if he could not see the calf he sought, to which the Dutchman
<br>
replied that he thought he could see a tail.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0015">STORY THE THIRTEENTH &mdash; THE CASTRATED CLERK.</a>
<br>
<i>How a lawyer's clerk in England deceived his master making him believe
<br>
that he had no testicles, by which reason he had charge over his
<br>
mistress both in the country and in the town, and enjoyed his pleasure.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0016">STORY THE FOURTEENTH &mdash; THE POPE-MAKER, OR THE HOLY MAN.</a>
<br>
<i>Of a hermit who deceived the daughter of a poor woman, making her
<br>
believe that her daughter should have a son by him who should become
<br>
Pope; and how, when she brought forth it was a girl, and thus was the
<br>
trickery of the hermit discovered, and for that cause he had to flee
<br>
from that countery.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0017">STORY THE FIFTEENTH &mdash; THE CLEVER NUN.</a>
<br>
<i>Of a nun whom a monk wished to deceive, and how he offered to shoo her

his weapon that she might feel it, but brought with him a companion whom

<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0018">STORY THE SIXTEENTH &mdash; ON THE BLIND SIDE.</a>
<br>
<i>Of a knight of Picardy who went to Prussia, and, meanwhile his lady
<br>
took a lover, and was in bed with him when her husband returned; and how
<br>
by a cunning trick she got her lover out of the room without the knight

being aware of it.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0019">STORY THE SEVENTEENTH &mdash; THE LAWYER AND THE BOLTING-MILL.</a>
<br>
<i>Of a President of Parliament, who fell in love with his chamber-maid,

went unto her mistress, who came and found her husband thus, as you will

afterwards hear.</i>
<br>
<a href="#2H_4_0020">STORY THE EIGHTEENTH &mdash; FROM BELLY TO BACK.</a>
<br>
<i>Of a gentleman of Burgundy who paid a chambermaid ten crowns to sleep

with her, but before he left her room, had his ten crowns back, and

made her carry him on her shoulders through the host's chamber. And in
<br>
passing by the said chamber he let wind so loudly that all was known, as
<br>
you will hear in the story which follows.</i>
<br>
<a href="#story19">STORY THE NINETEENTH &mdash; THE CHILD OF THE SNOW.</a>
<br>
<i>Of an English merchant whose wife had a child in his absence, and told

<a href="#2H_4_0021">STORY THE TWENTIETH &mdash; THE HUSBAND AS DOCTOR.</a>
<br>

<h2>
    INTRODUCTION
</h2>
<p>
The highest living authority on French Literature&mdash;Professor George
Saintsbury&mdash;has said:
</p>
<p>
"The <i>Cent Nouvelles</i> is undoubtedly the first work of literary prose in
French, and the first, moreover, of a long and most remarkable series of
literary works in which French writers may challenge all comers with the
certainty of victory. The short prose tale of a comic character is the
one French literary product the pre-eminence and perfection of which it
is impossible to dispute, and the prose tale first appears to advantage
in the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>. The subjects are by no means new.
They are simply the old themes of the <i>fabliaux</i> treated in the old way.
The novelty is in the application of prose to such a purpose, and in the
crispness, the fluency, and the elegance, of the prose used."
</p>
<p>
Besides the literary merits which the eminent critic has pointed out,
the stories give us curious glimpses of life in the 15th Century. We get
a genuine view of the social condition of the nobility and the middle
classes, and are pleasantly surprised to learn from the mouths of the
nobles themselves that the peasant was not the down-trodden serf that we
should have expected to find him a century after the Jacquerie, and 350
years before the Revolution.
</p>
<p>
In fact there is an atmosphere of tolerance, not to say <i>bonhommie</i>
about these stories which is very remarkable when we consider under what
circumstances they were told, and by whom, and to whom.
</p>
<p>
This seems to have struck M. Lenient, a French critic, who says:
</p>
<p>
"Generally the incidents and personages belong to the <i>bourgeoisée</i>;
there is nothing chivalric, nothing wonderful; no dreamy lovers,
romantic dames, fairies, or enchanters. Noble dames, bourgeois, nuns,
knights, merchants, monks, and peasants mutually dupe each other. The
lord deceives the miller's wife by imposing on her simplicity, and the
miller retaliates in much the same manner. The shepherd marries the
knight's sister, and the nobleman is not over scandalized.
</p>
<p>
"The vices of the monks are depicted in half a score tales, and the
seducers are punished with a severity not always in proportion to the
offence."
</p>
<p>
It seems curious that this valuable and interesting work has never
before been translated into English during the four and a half centuries
the book has been in existence. This is the more remarkable as the work
was edited in French by an English scholar&mdash;the late Thomas Wright. It
can hardly be the coarseness of some of the stories which has prevented
the <i>Nouvelles</i> from being presented to English readers when there are
half a dozen versions of the <i>Heptameron</i>, which is quite as coarse as
the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>, does not possess the same historical
interest, and is not to be compared to the present work as regards
either the stories or the style.
</p>
<p>
In addition to this, there is the history of the book itself, and
its connection with one of the most important personages in French
history&mdash;Louis XI. Indeed, in many French and English works of
reference, the authorship of the <i>Nouvelles</i> has been attributed to him,
and though in recent years, the writer is now believed&mdash;and no doubt
correctly&mdash;to have been Antoine de la Salle, it is tolerably certain
that Prince Louis heard all the stories related, and very possibly
contributed several of them. The circumstances under which these stories
came to be narrated requires a few words of explanation.
</p>
<p>
At a very early age, Louis showed those qualities by which he was later
distinguished. When he was only fourteen, he caused his father, Charles
VII, much grief, both by his unfilial conduct and his behaviour to the
beautiful Agnes Sorel, the King's mistress, towards whom he felt an
implacable hatred. He is said to have slapped her face, because he
thought she did not treat him with proper respect. This blow was, it is
asserted, the primary cause of his revolt against his father's authority
(1440). The rebellion was put down, and the Prince was pardoned, but
relations between father and son were still strained, and in 1446, Louis
had to betake himself to his appanage of Dauphiné, where he remained
for ten years, always plotting and scheming, and braving his father's
authority.
</p>
<p>
At length the Prince's Court at Grenoble became the seat of so many
conspiracies that Charles VII was obliged to take forcible measures.
It was small wonder that the King's patience was exhausted. Louis, not
content with the rule of his province, had made attempts to win over
many of the nobility, and to bribe the archers of the Scotch Guard.
Though not liberal as a rule, he had also expended large sums to
different secret agents for some specific purpose, which was in all
probability to secure his father's death, for he was not the sort of man
to stick at parricide even, if it would secure his ends.
</p>
<p>
The plot was revealed to Charles by Antoine de Chabannes, Comte de
Dampmartin. Louis, when taxed with his misconduct, impudently denied
that he had been mixed up with the conspiracy, but denounced all his
accomplices, and allowed them to suffer for his misdeeds. He did not,
however, forget to revenge them, so far as lay in his power. The fair
Agnès Sorel, whom he had always regarded as his bitterest enemy, died
shortly afterwards at Jumièges, and it has always been believed, and
with great show of reason, that she was poisoned by his orders. He was
not able to take vengeance on Antoine de Chabannes until after he became
King.
</p>
<p>
Finding that his plots were of no avail, he essayed to get together
an army large enough to combat his father, but before he completed his
plans, Charles VII, tired of his endless treason and trickery, sent an
army, under the faithful de Chabannes, into the Dauphiné, with orders to
arrest the Dauphin.
</p>
<p>
The forces which Louis had at his disposal were numerically so much
weaker, that he did not dare to risk a battle.
</p>
<p>
"If God or fortune," he cried, "had been kind enough to give me but half
the men-at-arms which now belong to the King, my father, and will be
mine some day, by Our Lady, my mistress, I would have spared him the
trouble of coming so far to seek me, but would have met him and fought
him at Lyon."
</p>
<p>
Not having sufficient forces, and feeling that he could not hope for
fresh pardon, he resolved to fly from France, and take refuge at the
Court of the Duke of Burgundy.
</p>
<p>
One day in June, 1456, he pretended to go hunting, and then, attended
by only half a dozen friends, rode as fast as he could into Burgundian
territory, and arrived at Saint Claude.
</p>
<p>
From there he wrote to his father, excusing his flight, and announcing
his intention of joining an expedition which Philippe le Bon, the
reigning Duke of Burgundy was about to undertake against the Turks. The
Duke was at that moment besieging Utrecht, but as soon as he heard the
Dauphin had arrived in his dominions, he sent orders that he was to
be conducted to Brussels with all the honours befitting his rank and
station.
</p>
<p>
Shortly afterwards the Duke returned, and listened with real or
pretended sympathy to all the complaints that Louis made against
his father, but put a damper on any hopes that the Prince may have
entertained of getting the Burgundian forces to support his cause, by
saying;
</p>
<p>
"Monseigneur, you are welcome to my domains. I am happy to see you here.
I will provide you with men and money for any purpose you may require,
except to be employed against the King, your father, whom I would on no
account displease."
</p>
<p>
Duke Philippe even tried to bring about a reconciliation between Charles
and his son; but as Louis was not very anxious to return to France, nor
Charles to have him there, and a good many of the nobles were far from
desiring that the Prince should come back, the negotiations came to
nothing.
</p>
<p>
Louis could make himself agreeable when he pleased, and during his stay
in the Duke's domains, he was on good terms with Philippe le Bon, who
granted him 3000 gold florins a month, and the castle of Genappe as a
residence. This castle was situated on the Dyle, midway between Brussels
and Louvain, and about eight miles from either city. The river, or a
deep moat, surrounded the castle on every side. There was a drawbridge
which was drawn up at night, so Louis felt himself quite safe from any
attack.
</p>
<p>
Here he remained five years (1456-1461) until the death of his father
placed him on the throne of France.
</p>
<p>
It was during these five years that these stories were told to amuse his
leisure. Probably there were many more than a hundred narrated&mdash;perhaps
several hundreds&mdash;but the literary man who afterwards "edited" the
stories only selected those which he deemed best, or, perhaps, those he
heard recounted. The narrators were the nobles who formed the Dauphin's
Court. Much ink has been spilled over the question whether Louis himself
had any share in the production. In nearly every case the author's name
is given, and ten of them (Nos. 2, 4, 7, 9, 11, 29, 33, 69, 70 and
71) are described in the original edition as being by "Monseigneur."
Publishers of subsequent editions brought out at the close of the 15th,
or the beginning of the 16th, Century, jumped to the conclusion that
"Monseigneur" was really the Dauphin, who not only contributed largely
to the book, but after he became King personally supervised the
publication of the collected stories.
</p>
<p>
For four centuries Louis XI was credited with the authorship of the
tales mentioned. The first person&mdash;so far as I am aware&mdash;to throw any
doubt on his claim was the late Mr. Thomas Wright, who edited an edition
of the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>, published by Jannet, Paris, 1858. He
maintained, with some show of reason, that as the stories were told in
Burgundy, by Burgundians, and the collected tales were "edited" by a
subject of the Duke (Antoine de la Salle, of whom I shall have occasion
to speak shortly) it was more probable that "Monseigneur" would mean the
Duke than the Dauphin, and he therefore ascribed the stories to Philippe
le Bel. Modern French scholars, however, appear to be of opinion that
"Monseigneur" was the Comte de Charolais, who afterwards became famous
as Charles le Téméraire, the last Duke of Burgundy.
</p>
<p>
The two great enemies were at that time close friends, and Charles was a
very frequent visitor to Genappe. It was not very likely, they say, that
Duke Philippe who was an old man would have bothered himself to tell
his guest indecent stories. On the other hand, Charles, being then only
Comte de Charolais, had no right to the title of "Monseigneur," but they
parry that difficulty by supposing that as he became Duke before
the tales were printed, the title was given him in the first printed
edition.
</p>
<p>
The matter is one which will, perhaps, never be satisfactorily settled.
My own opinion&mdash;though I claim for it no weight or value&mdash;is that Louis
appears to have the greatest right to the stories, though in support of
that theory I can only adduce some arguments, which if separately weak
may have some weight when taken collectively. Vérard, who published
the first edition, says in the Dedication; "Et notez que par toutes les
Nouvelles où il est dit par Monseigneur il est entendu par Monseigneur
le Dauphin, lequel depuis a succédé à la couronne et est le roy Loys
unsieme; car il estoit lors es pays du duc de Bourgoingne."
</p>
<p>
The critics may have good reason for throwing doubt on Vérard's
statement, but unless he printed his edition from a M.S. made after
1467, and the copyist had altered the name of the Comte de Charolais to
"Monseigneur" it is not easy to see how the error arose, whilst on the
other hand, as Vérard had every facility for knowing the truth, and some
of the copies must have been purchased by persons who were present when
the stories were told, the mistake would have been rectified in the
subsequent editions that Vérard brought out in the course of the next
few years, when Louis had been long dead and there was no necessity to
flatter his vanity.
</p>
<p>
On examining the stories related by "Monseigneur," it seems to me that
there is some slight internal evidence that they were told by Louis.
</p>
<p>
Brantôme says of him that, "he loved to hear tales of loose women,
and had but a poor opinion of woman and did not believe they were all
chaste. (This sounds well coming from Brantôme) Anyone who could relate
such tales was gladly welcomed by the Prince, who would have given all
Homer and Virgil too for a funny story." The Prince must have heard many
such stories, and would be likely to repeat them, and we find the
first half dozen stories are decidedly "broad," (No XI was afterwards
appropriated by Rabelais, as "Hans Carvel's Ring") and we may suspect
that Louis tried to show the different narrators by personal example
what he considered a really "good tale."
</p>
<p>
We know also Louis was subject to fits of religious melancholy, and
evinced a superstitious veneration for holy things, and even wore
little, leaden images of the saints round his hat. In many of the
stories we find monks punished for their immorality, or laughed at
for their ignorance, and nowhere do we see any particular veneration
displayed for the Church. The only exception is No LXX, "The Devil's
Horn," in which a knight by sheer faith in the mystery of baptism
vanquishes the Devil, whereas one of the knight's retainers, armed
with a battle-axe but not possessing his master's robust faith in the
efficacy of holy water, is carried off bodily, and never heard of again.
It seems to me that this story bears the stamp of the character of
Louis, who though suspicious towards men, was childishly credulous in
religious matters, but I leave the question for critics more capable
than I to decide.
</p>
<p>
Of the thirty-two noblemen or squires who contributed the other stories,
mention will be made in the notes. Of the stories, I may here mention
that 14 or 15 were taken from Boccaccio, and as many more from Poggio or
other Italian writers, or French <i>fabliaux</i>, but about 70 of them appear
to be original.
</p>
<p>
The knights and squires who told the stories had probably no great skill
as <i>raconteurs</i>, and perhaps did not read or write very fluently. The
tales were written down afterwards by a literary man, and they owe "the
crispness, fluency, and elegance," which, as Prof. Saintsbury remarks,
they possess in such a striking degree, to the genius of Antoine de la
Sale. He was born in 1398 in Burgundy or Touraine. He had travelled much
in Italy, and lived for some years at the Court of the Comte d' Anjou.
He returned to Burgundy later, and was, apparently, given some sort
of literary employment by Duke Philippe le Bel. At any rate he was
appointed by Philippe or Louis to record the stories that enlivened the
evenings at the Castle of Genappe, and the choice could not have fallen
on a better man. He was already known as the author of two or three
books, one of which&mdash;<i>Les Quinze Joyes de Mariage</i>&mdash;relates the woes
of married life, and displays a knowledge of character, and a quaint,
satirical humour that are truly remarkable, and remind the reader
alternately of Thackeray and Douglas Jerrold,&mdash;indeed some of the
Fifteen Joys are "Curtain Lectures" with a mediaeval environment, and
the word pictures of Woman's foibles, follies, and failings are as
bright to-day as when they were penned exactly 450 years ago. They show
that the "Eternal Feminine" has not altered in five centuries&mdash;perhaps
not in five thousand!
</p>
<p>
The practised and facile pen of Antoine de la Sale clothed the dry bones
of these stories with flesh and blood, and made them live, and move.
Considering his undoubted gifts as a humourist, and a delineator of
character it is strange that the name of Antoine de la Sale is not held
in higher veneration by his countrymen, for he was the earliest exponent
of a form of literary art in which the French have always excelled.
</p>
<p>
In making a translation of these stories I at first determined to adhere
as closely as possible to the text, but found that the versions differed
greatly. I have followed the two best modern editions, and have made as
few changes and omissions as possible.
</p>
<p>
Three or four of the stories are extremely coarse, and I hesitated
whether to omit them, insert them in the original French, or translate
them, but decided that as the book would only be read by persons of
education, respectability, and mature age, it was better to translate
them fully,&mdash;as has been done in the case of the far coarser passages of
Rabelais and other writers. This course appeared to me less hypocritical
than that adopted in a recent expensive edition of Boccaccio in which
the story of Rusticus and Alibech was given in French&mdash;with a highly
suggestive full-page illustration facing the text for the benefit of
those who could not read the French language.

<h2>
    STORY THE FIRST &mdash;THE REVERSE OF THE MEDAL. <a href="#note-1" name="noteref-1">1</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur Le Duc
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>The first story tells of how one found means to enjoy the wife of his
neighbour, whose husband he had sent away in order that he might have
her the more easily, and how the husband returning from his journey,
found his friend bathing with his wife. And not knowing who she was, he
wished to see her, but was permitted only to see her back&mdash;, and then
thought that she resembled his wife, but dared not believe it. And
thereupon left and found his wife at home, she having escaped by a
postern door, and related to her his suspicions.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In the town of Valenciennes there lived formerly a notable citizen, who
had been receiver of Hainault, who was renowned amongst all others
for his prudence and discretion, and amongst his praiseworthy virtues,
liberality was not the least, and thus it came to pass that he enjoyed
the grace of princes, lords, and other persons of good estate. And this
happy condition, Fortune granted and preserved to him to the end of his
days.
</p>
<p>
Both before and after death unloosed him from the chains of matrimony,
the good citizen mentioned in this Story, was not so badly lodged in
the said town but that many a great lord would have been content and
honoured to have such a lodging. His house faced several streets, in
one of which was a little postern door, opposite to which lived a good
comrade of his, who had a pretty wife, still young and charming.
</p>
<p>
And, as is customary, her eyes, the archers of the heart, shot so many
arrows into the said citizen, that unless he found some present remedy,
he felt his case was no less than mortal.
</p>
<p>
To more surely prevent such a fate, he found many and subtle manners of
making the good comrade, the husband of the said quean, his private and
familiar friend, so, that few of the dinners, suppers, banquets, baths,
and other such amusements took place, either in the hotel or elsewhere,
without his company. And of such favours his comrade was very proud, and
also happy.
</p>
<p>
When our citizen, who was more cunning than a fox, had gained the
good-will of his friend, little was needed to win the love of his wife,
and in a few days he had worked so much and so well that the gallant
lady was fain to hear his case, and to provide a suitable remedy
thereto. It remained but to provide time and place; and for this she
promised him that, whenever her husband lay abroad for a night, she
would advise him thereof.
</p>
<p>
The wished-for day arrived when the husband told his wife that he was
going to a chateau some three leagues distant from Valenciennes, and
charged her to look after the house and keep within doors, because his
business would not permit him to return that night.
</p>
<p>
It need not be asked if she was joyful, though she showed it not either
in word, or deed, or otherwise. Her husband had not journeyed a league
before the citizen knew that the opportunity had come.
</p>
<p>
He caused the baths to be brought forth, and the stoves to be heated,
and pasties, tarts, and hippocras, and all the rest of God's good gifts,
to be prepared largely and magnificently.
</p>
<p>
When evening came, the postern door was unlocked, and she who was
expected entered thereby, and God knows if she was not kindly received.
I pass over all this.
</p>
<p>
Then they ascended into a chamber, and washed in a bath, by the side of
which a good supper was quickly laid and served. And God knows if they
drank often and deeply. To speak of the wines and viands would be
a waste of time, and, to cut the story short, there was plenty of
everything. In this most happy condition passed the great part of this
sweet but short night; kisses often given and often returned, until they
desired nothing but to go to bed.
</p>
<p>
Whilst they were thus making good cheer, the husband returned from his
journey, and knowing nothing of this adventure, knocked loudly at the
door of the house. And the company that was in the ante-chamber refused
him entrance until he should name his surety.
</p>
<p>
Then he gave his name loud and clear, and so his good wife and the
citizen heard him and knew him. She was so amazed to hear the voice of
her husband that her loyal heart almost failed her; and she would have
fainted, had not the good citizen and his servants comforted her.
</p>
<p>
The good citizen being calm and well advised how to act, made haste
to put her to bed, and lay close by her; and charged her well that she
should lie close to him and hide her face, so that no one could see it.
And that being done as quickly as may be, yet without too much haste,
he ordered that the door should be opened. Then his good comrade sprang
into the room, thinking to himself that there must be some mystery, else
they had not kept him out of the room. And when he saw the table laid
with wines and goodly viands, also the bath finely prepared, and the
citizen in a handsome bed, well curtained, with a second person by
his side, God knows he spoke loudly, and praised the good cheer of his
neighbour. He called him rascal, and whore-monger, and drunkard, and
many other names, which made those who were in the chamber laugh long
and loud; but his wife could not join in the mirth, her face being
pressed to the side of her new friend.
</p>
<p>
"Ha!" said the husband, "Master whore-monger, you have well hidden from
me this good cheer; but, by my faith, though I was not at the feast, you
must show me the bride."
</p>
<p>
And with that, holding a candle in his hand, he drew near the bed, and
would have withdrawn the coverlet, under which, in fear and silence,
lay his most good and perfect wife, when the citizen and his servants
prevented him; but he was not content, and would by force, in spite of
them all, have laid his hand upon the bed.
</p>
<p>
But he was not master there, and could not have his will, and for good
cause, and was fain to be content with a most gracious proposal which
was made to him, and which was this, that he should be shown the
backside of his wife, and her haunches, and thighs&mdash;which were big and
white, and moreover fair and comely&mdash;without uncovering and beholding
her face.
</p>
<p>
The good comrade, still holding a candle in his hand, gazed for long
without saying a word; and when he did speak, it was to praise highly
the great beauty of that dame, and he swore by a great oath that he had
never seen anything that so much resembled the back parts of his own
wife, and that were he not well sure that she was at home at that time,
he would have said it was she.
</p>
<p>
She had by this somewhat recovered, and he drew back much disconcerted,
but God knows that they all told him, first one and then the other, that
he had judged wrongly, and spoken against the honour of his wife, and
that this was some other woman, as he would afterwards see for himself.
</p>
<p>
To restore him to good humour, after they had thus abused his eyes, the
citizen ordered that they should make him sit at the table, where he
drowned his suspicions by eating and drinking of what was left of the
supper, whilst they in the bed were robbing him of his honour.
</p>
<p>
The time came to leave, and he said good night to the citizen and his
companions, and begged they would let him leave by the postern door,
that he might the sooner return home. But the citizen replied that he
knew not then where to find the key; he thought also that the lock was
so rusted that they could not open the door, which they rarely if ever
used. He was content therefore to leave by the front gate, and make a
long detour to reach his house, and whilst the servants of the citizen
led him to the door, the good wife was quickly on her feet, and in a
short time, clad in a simple sark, with her corset on her arm, and come
to the postern. She made but one bound to her house, where she awaited
her husband (who came by a longer way) well-prepared as to the manner in
which she should receive him.
</p>
<p>
Soon came our man, and seeing still a light in the house, knocked at the
door loudly; and this good wife, who was pretending to clean the house,
and had a besom in her hands, asked &mdash; what she knew well; "Who is
there?"
</p>
<p>
And he replied; "It is your husband."
</p>
<p>
"My husband!" said she. "My husband is not here! He is not in the town!"
</p>
<p>
With that he knocked again, and cried, "Open the door! I am your
husband."
</p>
<p>
"I know my husband well," quoth she, "and it is not his custom to return
home so late at night, when he is in the town. Go away, and do not knock
here at this hour."
</p>
<p>
But he knocked all the more, and called her by name once or twice. Yet
she pretended not to know him, and asked why he came at that hour, but
for all reply he said nothing but, "Open! Open!"
</p>
<p>
"Open!" said she. "What! are you still there you rascally whore-monger?
By St. Mary, I would rather see you drown than come in here! Go! and
sleep as badly as you please in the place where you came from."
</p>
<p>
Then her good husband grew angry, and thundered against the door as
though he would knock the house down, and threatened to beat his wife,
such was his rage,&mdash;of which she had not great fear; but at length,
because of the noise he made, and that she might the better speak her
mind to him, she opened the door, and when he entered, God knows whether
he did not see an angry face, and have a warm greeting. For when her
tongue found words from a heart overcharged with anger and indignation,
her language was as sharp as well-ground Guingant razors.
</p>
<p>
And, amongst other things, she reproached him that he had wickedly
pretended a journey in order that he might try her, and that he was a
coward and a recreant, unworthy to have such a wife as she was.
</p>
<p>
Our good comrade, though he had been angry, saw how wrong he had been,
and restrained his wrath, and the indignation that in his heart he had
conceived when he was standing outside the door was turned aside. So he
said, to excuse himself, and to satisfy his wife, that he had returned
from his journey because he had forgotten a letter concerning the object
of his going.
</p>
<p>
Pretending not to believe him, she invented more stories, and charged
him with having frequented taverns and bagnios, and other improper and
dissolute resorts, and that he behaved as no respectable man should, and
she cursed the hour in which she had made his acquaintance, and doubly
cursed the day she became his wife.
</p>
<p>
The poor man, much grieved, seeing his wife more troubled than he liked,
knew not what to say. And his suspicions being removed, he drew near
her, weeping and falling upon his knees and made the following fine
speech.
</p>
<p>
"My most dear companion, and most loyal wife, I beg and pray of you
to remove from your heart the wrath you have conceived against me, and
pardon me for all that I have done against you. I own my fault, I see
my error. I have come now from a place where they made good cheer, and
where, I am ashamed to say, I fancied I recognised you, at which I was
much displeased. And so I wrongfully and causelessly suspected you to be
other than a good woman, of which I now repent bitterly, and pray of you
to forgive me, and pardon my folly."
</p>
<p>
The good woman, seeing her husband so contrite, showed no great anger.
</p>
<p>
"What?" said she, "You have come from filthy houses of ill-fame, and you
dare to think that your honest wife would be seen in such places?"
</p>
<p>
"No, no, my dear, I know you would not. For God's sake, say no more
about it." said the good man, and repeated his aforesaid request.
</p>
<p>
She, seeing his contrition, ceased her reproaches, and little by little
regained her composure, and with much ado pardoned him, after he had
made a hundred thousand oaths and promises to her who had so wronged
him. And from that time forth she often, without fear or regret, passed
the said postern, nor were her escapades discovered by him who was most
concerned. And that suffices for the first story.

<h2>
    STORY THE SECOND &mdash; THE MONK-DOCTOR.
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>The second story, related by Duke Philip, is of a young girl who had
piles, who put out the only eye he had of a Cordelier monk who was
healing her, and of the lawsuit that followed thereon.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In the chief town of England, called London, which is much resorted to
by many folks, there lived, not long ago, a rich and powerful man who
was a merchant and citizen, who beside his great wealth and treasures,
was enriched by the possession of a fair daughter, whom God had given
him over and above his substance, and who for goodness, prettiness,
and gentleness, surpassed all others of her time, and who when she was
fifteen was renowned for her virtue and beauty.
</p>
<p>
God knows that many folk of good position desired and sought for her
good grace by all the divers manners used by lovers,&mdash;which was no
small pleasure to her father and mother, and increased their ardent and
paternal affection for their beloved daughter.
</p>
<p>
But it happened that, either by the permission of God, or that Fortune
willed and ordered it so, being envious and discontented at the
prosperity of this beautiful girl, or of her parents, or all of
them,&mdash;or may be from some secret and natural cause that I leave to
doctors and philosophers to determine, that she was afflicted with an
unpleasant and dangerous disease which is commonly called piles.
</p>
<p>
The worthy family was greatly troubled when they found the fawn they so
dearly loved, set on by the sleuth-hounds and beagles of this unpleasant
disease, which had, moreover, attacked its prey in a dangerous place.
The poor girl&mdash;utterly cast down by this great misfortune,&mdash;could do
naught else than weep and sigh. Her grief-stricken mother was much
troubled; and her father, greatly vexed, wrung his hands, and tore his
hair in his rage at this fresh misfortune.
</p>
<p>
Need I say that all the pride of that household was suddenly cast down
to the ground, and in one moment converted into bitter and great grief.
</p>
<p>
The relations, friends, and neighbours of the much-enduring family came
to visit and comfort the damsel; but little or nothing might they profit
her, for the poor girl was more and more attacked and oppressed by that
disease.
</p>
<p>
Then came a matron who had much studied that disease, and she turned and
re-turned the suffering patient, this way, and that way, to her great
pain and grief, God knows, and made a medicine of a hundred thousand
sorts of herbs, but it was no good; the disease continued to get worse,
so there was no help but to send for all the doctors of the city and
round about, and for the poor girl to discover unto them her most
piteous case.
</p>
<p>
There came Master Peter, Master John, Master This, Master That&mdash;as many
doctors as you would, who all wished to see the patient together, and
uncover that portion of her body where this cursed disease, the piles
had, alas, long time concealed itself.
</p>
<p>
The poor girl, as much cast down and grieved as though she were
condemned to die, would in no wise agree or permit that her affliction
should be known; and would rather have died than shown such a secret
place to the eyes of any man.
</p>
<p>
This obstinacy though endured not long, for her father and her mother
came unto her, and remonstrated with her many times,&mdash;saying that she
might be the cause of her own death, which was no small sin; and many
other matters too long to relate here.
</p>
<p>
Finally, rather to obey her father and mother than from fear of death,
the poor girl allowed herself to be bound and laid on a couch, head
downwards, and her body so uncovered that the physicians might see
clearly the seat of the disease which troubled her.
</p>
<p>
They gave orders what was to be done, and sent apothecaries with
clysters, powders, ointments, and whatsoever else seemed good unto them;
and she took all that they sent, in order that she might recover her
health.
</p>
<p>
But all was of no avail, for no remedy that the said physicians could
apply helped to heal the distressing malady from which she suffered, nor
could they find aught in their books, until at last the poor girl, what
with grief and pain was more dead than alive, and this grief and great
weakness lasted many days.
</p>
<p>
And whilst the father and mother, relations, and neighbours sought for
aught that might alleviate their daughter's sufferings, they met with
an old Cordelier monk, who was blind of one eye, and who in his time
had seen many things, and had dabbled much in medicine, therefore his
presence was agreeable to the relations of the patient, and he having
gazed at the diseased part at his leisure, boasted much that he could
cure her.
</p>
<p>
You may fancy that he was most willingly heard, and that all the
grief-stricken assembly, from whose hearts all joy had been banished,
hoped that the result would prove as he had promised.
</p>
<p>
Then he left, and promised that he would return the next day, provided
and furnished with a drug of such virtue, that it would at once remove
the great pain and martyrdom which tortured and annoyed the poor
patient.
</p>
<p>
The night seemed over-long, whilst waiting for the wished-for morrow;
nevertheless, the long hours passed, and our worthy Cordelier kept his
promise, and came to the patient at the hour appointed. You may guess
that he was well and joyously received; and when the time came when he
was to heal the patient, they placed her as before on a couch, with her
backside covered with a fair white cloth of embroidered damask, having,
where her malady was, a hole pierced in it through which the Cordelier
might arrive at the said place.
</p>
<p>
He gazed at the seat of the disease, first from one side, then from the
other: and anon he would touch it gently with his finger, or inspect the
tube by which he meant to blow in the powder which was to heal her, or
anon would step back and inspect the diseased parts, and it seemed as
though he could never gaze enough.
</p>
<p>
At last he took the powder in his left hand, poured upon a small flat
dish, and in the other hand the tube, which he filled with the said
powder, and as he gazed most attentively and closely through the opening
at the seat of the painful malady of the poor girl, she could not
contain herself, seeing the strange manner in which the Cordelier gazed
at her with his one eye, but a desire to burst out laughing came upon
her, though she restrained herself as long as she could.
</p>
<p>
But it came to pass, alas! that the laugh thus held back was converted
into a f&mdash;t, the wind of which caught the powder, so that the greater
part of it was blown into the face and into the eye of the good
Cordelier, who, feeling the pain, dropped quickly both plate and tube,
and almost fell backwards, so much was he frightened. And when he came
to himself, he quickly put his hand to his eye, complaining loudly, and
saying that he was undone, and in danger to lose the only good eye he
had.
</p>
<p>
Nor did he lie, for in a few days, the powder which was of a corrosive
nature, destroyed and ate away his eye, so that he became, and remained,
blind.
</p>
<p>
Then he caused himself to be led one day to the house where he had met
with this sad mischance, and spoke to the master of the house, to whom
he related his pitiful case, demanding, as was his right, that there
should be granted to him such amends as his condition deserved, in order
that he might live honourably.
</p>
<p>
The merchant replied that though the misadventure greatly vexed him, he
was in nowise the cause of it, nor could he in any way be charged with
it, but that he would, out of pity and charity, give him some money, and
though the Cordelier had undertaken to cure his daughter and had not
so done, would give him as much as he would if she had been restored to
health, though not forced to do so.
</p>
<p>
The Cordelier was not content with this offer, but required that he
should be kept for the rest of his life, seeing that the merchant's
daughter had blinded him, and that in the presence of many people, and
thereby he was deprived from ever again performing Mass or any of the
services of the Holy Church, or studying what learned men had written
concerning the Holy Scriptures, and thus could no longer serve as a
preacher; which would be his destruction, for he would be a beggar and
without means, save alms, and these he could no longer obtain.
</p>
<p>
But all that he could say was of no avail, and he could get no other
answer than that given. So he cited the merchant before the Parliament
of the said city of London, which called upon the aforesaid merchant to
appear. When the day came, the Cordelier's case was stated by a lawyer
well-advised as to what he should say, and God knows that many came to
the Court to hear this strange trial, which much pleased the lords of
the said Parliament, as much for the strangeness of the case as for the
allegations and arguments of the parties debating therein, which were
not only curious but amusing.
</p>
<p>
To many folk was this strange and amusing case known, and was often
adjourned and left undecided by the judges, as is their custom. And
so she, who before this was renowned for her beauty, goodness, and
gentleness, became notorious through this cursed disease of piles, but
was in the end cured, as I have been since told.

<h2>
    STORY THE THIRD &mdash; THE SEARCH FOR THE RING. <a href="#note-3" name="noteref-3">3</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur de la Roche
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of the deceit practised by a knight on a miller's wife whom he made
believe that her front was loose, and fastened it many times. And the
miller informed of this, searched for a diamond that the knight's lady
had lost, and found it in her body, as the knight knew afterwards: so he
called the miller "fisherman", and the miller called him "fastener".</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In the Duchy of Burgundy lived formerly a noble knight, whose name is
not mentioned in the present story, who was married to a fair and
gentle lady. And near the castle of the said knight lived a miller, also
married to a fair young wife.
</p>
<p>
It chanced once, that the knight, to pass the time and enjoy himself,
was strolling around his castle, and by the banks of the river on which
stood the house and mill of the said miller, who at that time was not at
home, but at Dijon or Beaune,&mdash;he saw and remarked the wife of the said
miller carrying two jars and returning from the river, whither she had
been to draw water.
</p>
<p>
He advanced towards her and saluted her politely, and she, being
well-mannered, made him the salutation which belonged to his rank. The
knight, finding that the miller's wife was very fair but had not much
sense, drew near to her and said.
</p>
<p>
"Of a truth, my friend, I see well that you are in ill case, and
therefore in great peril."
</p>
<p>
At these words the miller's wife replied.
</p>
<p>
"Alas, monseigneur, and what shall I do?"
</p>
<p>
"Truly, my dear, if you walk thus, your 'front piece' is in danger
of falling off, and if I am not mistaken, you will not keep it much
longer."
</p>
<p>
The foolish woman, on hearing these words was astonished and
vexed;&mdash;astonished to think how the knight could know, without seeing,
of this unlucky accident, and vexed to think of the loss of the best
part of her body, and one that she used well, and her husband also.
</p>
<p>
She replied; "Alas! sir, what is this you tell me, and how do you know
that my 'front piece' is in danger of falling off? It seems to keep its
place well."
</p>
<p>
"There, there! my dear," replied the knight. "Let it suffice that I have
told you the truth. You would not be the first to whom such a thing had
happened."
</p>
<p>
"Alas, sir," said she. "I shall be an undone, dishonoured and lost
woman; and what will my husband say when he hears of the mischance? He
will have no more to do with me."
</p>
<p>
"Be not discomforted to that degree, my friend; it has not happened yet;
besides there is a sure remedy."
</p>
<p>
When the young woman heard that there was a remedy for her complaint,
her blood began to flow again, and she begged the knight for God's sake
that he would teach her what she must do to keep this poor front-piece
from falling off. The knight, who was always most courteous and
gracious, especially towards the ladies, replied;
</p>
<p>
"My friend, as you are a good and pretty girl, and I like your husband,
I will teach you how to keep your front-piece."
</p>
<p>
"Alas, sir, I thank you; and certainly you will do a most meritorious
work: for it would be better to die than to live without my front-piece.
And what ought I to do sir?
</p>
<p>
"My dear," he said, "to prevent your front-piece from falling off, you
must have it fastened quickly and often."
</p>
<p>
"Fastened, sir? And who will do that? Whom shall I ask to do this for
me?"
</p>
<p>
"I will tell you, my dear," replied the knight. "And because I warned
you of this mischance being so near, and told you of the remedy
necessary to obviate the inconveniences which would arise, and which
I am sure would not please you,&mdash;I am content, in order to further
increase the love between us, to fasten your front-piece, and put it in
such a good condition that you may safely carry it anywhere, without any
fear or doubt that it will ever fall off; for in this matter I am very
skilful."
</p>
<p>
It need not be asked whether the miller's wife was joyful. She employed
all the little sense she had to thank the knight. So they walked
together, she and the knight, back to the mill, where they were no
sooner arrived than the knight kindly began his task, and with a tool
that he had, shortly fastened, three or four times, the front-piece of
the miller's wife, who was most pleased and joyous; and after having
appointed a day when he might again work at this front-piece, the knight
left, and returned quickly to his castle.
</p>
<p>
On the day named, he went again to the mill, and did his best, in the
way above mentioned, to fasten this front-piece; and so well did he work
as time went on, that this front-piece was most safely fastened, and
held firmly and well in its place.
</p>
<p>
Whilst our knight thus fastened the front-piece of the miller's wife,
the miller one day returned from his business, and made good cheer, as
also did his wife. And as they were talking over their affairs, this
most wise wife said to her husband.
</p>
<p>
"On my word, we are much indebted to the lord of this town."
</p>
<p>
"Tell me how, and in what manner," replied the miller.
</p>
<p>
"It is quite right that I should tell you, that you may thank him, as
indeed you must. The truth is that, whilst you were away, my lord passed
by our house one day that I was carrying two pitchers from the river.
He saluted me and I did the same to him; and as I walked away, he saw,
I know not how, that my front-piece was not held properly, and was
in danger of falling off. He kindly told me so, at which I was as
astonished and vexed as though the end of the world had come. The good
lord who saw me thus lament, took pity on me, and showed me a good
remedy for this cursed disaster. And he did still more, which he would
not have done for every one, for the remedy of which he told me,&mdash;which
was to fasten and hold back my front-piece in order to prevent it from
dropping off,&mdash;he himself applied, which was great trouble to him, and
he did it many times because that my case required frequent attention.
</p>
<p>
"What more shall I say? He, has so well performed his work that we can
never repay him. By my faith, he has in one day of this week fastened it
three times; another day, four times; another day, twice; another day,
three times; and he never left me till I was quite cured, and brought
to such a condition that my front-piece now holds as well and firmly as
that of any woman in our town."
</p>
<p>
The miller, on hearing this adventure, gave no outward sign of what
was passing in his mind, but, as though he had been joyful, said to his
wife:
</p>
<p>
"I am very glad, my dear, that my lord hath done us this service, and,
God willing, when it shall be possible, I will do as much for him. But
at any rate, as it is not proper it should be known, take care that you
say no word of this to anyone; and also, now that you are cured, you
need not trouble my lord any further in this matter."
</p>
<p>
"You have warned me," replied his wife, "not to say a word about it and
that is also what my lord bade me."
</p>
<p>
Our miller, who was a good fellow, often thought over the kindness that
my lord had done him, and conducted himself so wisely and carefully that
the said lord never suspected that he knew how he had been deceived, and
imagined that he knew nothing. But alas, his heart and all his thoughts
were bent on revenge and how he could repay in like manner the deceit
practised on his wife. And at length he bethought himself of a way by
which he could, he imagined, repay my lord in butter for his eggs.
</p>
<p>
At last, owing to other circumstances, the knight was obliged to mount
his horse and say farewell to his wife for a month; at which our miller
was in no small degree pleased.
</p>
<p>
One day, the lady had a desire to bathe, and caused the bath to be
brought forth and the stoves to be heated in her private apartments; of
which our miller knew soon, because he learned all that went on in the
house; so he took a fine pike, that he kept in the ditch near his house,
and went to the castle to present it to the lady.
</p>
<p>
None of the waiting-women would he let take the fish, but said that he
must present it himself to the lady, or else he would take it back home.
At last, because he was well-known to the household, and a good fellow,
the lady allowed him to enter whilst she was in her bath.
</p>
<p>
The miller gave his present, for which the lady thanked him, and caused
it to be taken to the kitchen and cooked for supper.
</p>
<p>
Whilst he was talking, the miller perceived on the edge of the bath, a
fine large diamond which she had taken from her finger, fearing lest the
water should spoil it. He took it so quietly that no one saw him, and
having gained his point, said good night to the lady and her women, and
returned to the mill to think over his business.
</p>
<p>
The lady, who was making good cheer with her attendants, seeing that
it was now very late, and supper-time, left the bath and retired to
her bed. And as she was looking at her arms and hands, she saw not the
diamond, and she called her women, and asked them where was the diamond,
and to whom she had given it. Each said, "It was not to me;"&mdash;"Nor to
me,"&mdash;"Nor to me either."
</p>
<p>
They searched inside and outside the bath, and everywhere, but it was no
good, they could not find it. The search for this diamond lasted a long
time, without their finding any trace of it, which caused the lady much
vexation, because it had been unfortunately lost in her chamber, and
also because my lord had given it to her the day of their betrothal, and
she held it very precious. They did not know whom to suspect nor whom to
ask, and much sorrow prevailed in the household.
</p>
<p>
Then one of the women bethought herself, and said.
</p>
<p>
"No one entered the room but ourselves and the miller; it seems right
that he should be sent for."
</p>
<p>
He was sent for, and came. The lady who was much vexed, asked the miller
if he had not seen her diamond. He, being as ready to lie as another is
to tell the truth, answered boldly, and asked if the lady took him for a
thief? To which she replied gently;
</p>
<p>
"Certainly not, miller; it would be no theft if you had for a joke taken
away my diamond."
</p>
<p>
"Madame," said the miller, "I give you my word that I know nothing about
your diamond."
</p>
<p>
Then were they all much vexed, and my lady especially, so that she could
not refrain from weeping tears in great abundance at the loss of this
trinket. They all sorrowfully considered what was to be done. One said
that it must be in the chamber, and another said that they had searched
everywhere, and that it was impossible it should be there or they would
have found it, as it was easily seen.
</p>
<p>
The miller asked the lady if she had it when she entered the bath; and
she replied, yes.
</p>
<p>
"If it be so, certainly, madam, considering the diligence you have made
in searching for it, and without finding it, the affair is very strange.
Nevertheless, it seems to me that if there is any man who could give
advice how it should be found, I am he, and because I would not that
my secret should be discovered and known to many people, it would be
expedient that I should speak to you alone."
</p>
<p>
"That is easily managed," said the lady. So her attendants left, but, as
they were leaving, Dames Jehanne, Isabeau, and Katherine said,
</p>
<p>
"Ah, miller, you will be a clever man if you bring back this diamond."
</p>
<p>
"I don't say that I am over-clever," replied the miller, "but I venture
to declare that if it is possible to find it I am the man to do so."
</p>
<p>
When he saw that he was alone with the lady, he told her that he
believed seriously, that as she had the diamond when she entered the
bath, that it must have fallen from her finger and entered her body,
seeing that there was no one who could have stolen it.
</p>
<p>
And that he might hasten to find it, he made the lady-get upon her bed,
which she would have willingly refused if she could have done otherwise.
</p>
<p>
After he had uncovered her, he pretended to look here and there, and
said,
</p>
<p>
"Certainly, madam, the diamond has entered your body."
</p>
<p>
"Do you say, miller, that you have seen it?"
</p>
<p>
"Truly, yes."
</p>
<p>
"Alas!" said she, "and how can it be got out?"
</p>
<p>
"Very easily, madam. I doubt not to succeed if it please you."
</p>
<p>
"May God help you! There is nothing that I would not do to get it
again," said the lady, "or to advance you, good miller."
</p>
<p>
The miller placed the lady on the bed, much in the same position as the
lord had placed <i>his</i> wife when he fastened her front-piece, and with a
like tool was the search for the diamond made.
</p>
<p>
Whilst resting after the first and second search that the miller made
for the diamond, the lady asked him if he had not felt it, and he said,
yes, at which she was very joyful, and begged that he would seek until
he had found it.
</p>
<p>
To cut matters short, the good miller did so well that he restored to
the lady her beautiful diamond, which caused great joy throughout the
house, and never did miller receive so much honour and advancement as
the lady and her maids bestowed upon him.
</p>
<p>
The good miller, who was high in the good graces of the lady after the
much-desired conclusion of his great enterprise, left the house and went
home, without boasting to his wife of his recent adventure, though he
was more joyful over it than though he had gained the whole world.
</p>
<p>
A short time after, thank God, the knight returned to his castle, and
was kindly received and humbly welcomed by the lady, who whilst
they were enjoying themselves in bed, told him of the most wonderful
adventure of the diamond, and how it was fished out of her body by the
miller; and, to cut matters short, related the process, fashion, and
manner employed by the said miller in his search for the diamond, which
hardly gave her husband much joy, but he reflected that the miller had
paid him back in his own coin.
</p>
<p>
The first time he met the good miller, he saluted him coldly, and said,
</p>
<p>
"God save you! God save you, good diamond-searcher!"
</p>
<p>
To which the good miller replied,
</p>
<p>
"God save you! God save you, fastener of front-pieces!"
</p>
<p>
"By our Lady, you speak truly," said the knight. "Say nothing about me,
and I will say nothing about you."
</p>
<p>
The miller was satisfied, and never spoke of it again; nor did the
knight either, so far as I know.

<h2>
    STORY THE FOURTH &mdash; THE ARMED CUCKOLD. <a href="#note-4" name="noteref-4">4</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>The fourth tale is of a Scotch archer who was in love with a fair
and gentle dame, the wife of a mercer, who, by her husband's orders
appointed a day for the said Scot to visit her, who came and treated her
as he wished, the said mercer being hid by the side of the bed, where he
could see and hear all.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
When the king was lately in the city of Tours, a Scottish gentleman, an
archer of his bodyguard, was greatly enamoured of a beautiful and gentle
damsel married to a mercer; and when he could find time and place,
related to her his sad case, but received no favourable reply,&mdash;at which
he was neither content nor joyous. Nevertheless, as he was much in
love, he relaxed not the pursuit, but besought her so eagerly, that the
damsel, wishing to drive him away for good and all, told him that she
would inform her husband of the dishonourable and damnable proposals
made to her,&mdash;which at length she did.
</p>
<p>
The husband,&mdash;a good and wise man, honourable and valiant, as you will
see presently,&mdash;was very angry to think that the Scot would dishonour
him and his fair wife. And that he might avenge himself without trouble,
he commanded his wife that if the Scot should accost her again, she
should appoint a meeting on a certain day, and, if he were so foolish as
to come, he would buy his pleasure dearly.
</p>
<p>
The good wife, to obey her husband's will, did as she was told. The poor
amorous Scot, who spent his time in passing the house, soon saw the
fair mercer, and when he had humbly saluted her, he besought her love
so earnestly, and desired that she would listen to his final piteous
prayer, and if she would, never should woman be more loyally served and
obeyed if she would but grant his most humble and reasonable request.
</p>
<p>
The fair mercer, remembering the lesson that her husband had given her,
finding the opportunity propitious, after many subterfuges and excuses,
told the Scot that he could come to her chamber on the following
evening, where he could talk to her more secretly, and she would give
him what he desired.
</p>
<p>
You may guess that she was greatly thanked, and her words listened to
with pleasure and obeyed by her lover, who left his lady feeling more
joyous than ever he had in his life.
</p>
<p>
When the husband returned home, he was told of all the words and deeds
of the Scot, and how he was to come on the morrow to the lady's chamber.
</p>
<p>
"Let him come," said the husband. "Should he undertake such a mad
business I will make him, before he leaves, see and confess the evil he
has done, as an example to other daring and mad fools like him."
</p>
<p>
The evening of the next day drew near,&mdash;much to the joy of the amorous
Scot, who wished to see and enjoy the person of his lady;&mdash;and much also
to the joy of the good mercer who was desiring a great vengeance to
be taken on the person of the Scot who wished to replace him in the
marriage bed; but not much to the taste of his fair wife, who expected
that her obedience to her husband would lead to a serious fight.
</p>
<p>
All prepared themselves; the mercer put on a big, old, heavy suit
of armour, donned his helmet and gauntlets, and armed himself with a
battle-axe. Like a true champion, he took up his post early, and as he
had no tent in which to await his enemy, placed himself behind a curtain
by the side of the bed, where he was so well-hidden that he could not be
perceived.
</p>
<p>
The lover, sick with desire, knowing the longed-for hour was now at
hand, set out for the house of the mercer, but he did not forget to
take his big, good, strong two-handed sword; and when he was within the
house, the lady went up to her chamber without showing any fear, and
he followed her quietly. And when he came within the room, he asked the
lady if she were alone? To which she replied casually, and with some
confusion, that she was.
</p>
<p>
"Tell me the truth," said the Scot. "Is not your husband here?"
</p>
<p>
"No," said she.
</p>
<p>
"Well! let him come! By Saint Aignan, if he should come, I would split
his skull to the teeth. By God! if there were three of them I should not
fear them. I should soon master them!"
</p>
<p>
After these wicked words, he drew his big, good sword, and brandished it
three or four times; then laid it on the bed by his side.
</p>
<p>
With that he kissed and cuddled her, and did much more at his leisure
and convenience, without the poor coward by the side of the bed, who was
greatly afraid he should be killed, daring to show himself.
</p>
<p>
Our Scot, after this adventure, took leave of the lady for a while, and
thanked her as he ought for her great courtesy and kindness, and went
his way.
</p>
<p>
As soon as the valiant man of arms knew that the Scot was out of the
house, he came out of his hiding place, so frightened that he could
scarcely speak, and commenced to upbraid his wife for having let the
archer do his pleasure on her. To which she replied that it was his
fault, as he had made her appoint a meeting.
</p>
<p>
"I did not command you," he said, "to let him do his will and pleasure."
</p>
<p>
"How could I refuse him," she replied, "seeing that he had his big
sword, with which he could have killed me?"
</p>
<p>
At that moment the Scot returned, and came up the stairs to the chamber,
and ran in and called out, "What is it?" Whereupon the good man, to save
himself, hid under the bed for greater safety, being more frightened
than ever.
</p>
<p>
The Scot served the lady as he had done before, but kept his sword
always near him. After many long love-games between the Scot and the
lady, the hour came when he must leave, so he said good-night and went
away.
</p>
<p>
The poor martyr who was under the bed would scarcely come out, so much
did he fear the return of his adversary,&mdash;or rather, I should say, his
companion. At last he took courage, and by the help of his wife was,
thank God, set on his feet, and if he had scolded his wife before he was
this time harder upon her than ever, for she had consented, in spite of
his forbidding her, to dishonour him and herself.
</p>
<p>
"Alas," said she, "and where is the woman bold enough to oppose a man so
hasty and violent as he was, when you yourself, armed and accoutred and
so valiant,&mdash;and to whom he did more wrong than he did to me&mdash;did not
dare to attack him, and defend me?"
</p>
<p>
"That is no answer," he replied. "Unless you had liked, he would never
have attained his purpose. You are a bad and disloyal woman."
</p>
<p>
"And you," said she, "are a cowardly, wicked, and most blamable man; for
I am dishonoured since, through obeying you, I gave a rendezvous to the
Scot. Yet you have not the courage to undertake the defence of the wife
who is the guardian of your honour. For know that I would rather have
died than consent to this dishonour, and God knows what grief I feel,
and shall always feel as long as I live, whilst he to whom I looked for
help suffered me to be dishonoured in his presence."
</p>
<p>
He believed that she would not have allowed the Scot to tumble her if
she had not taken pleasure in it, but she maintained that she was forced
and could not resist, but left the resistance to him and he did not
fulfil his charge. Thus they both wrangled and quarrelled, with many
arguments on both sides. But at any rate, the husband was cuckolded and
deceived by the Scot in the manner you have heard.

<h2>
    STORY THE FIFTH &mdash; THE DUEL WITH THE BUCKLE-STRAP. <a href="#note-5" name="noteref-5">5</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Philippe De Laon.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>The fifth story relates two judgments of Lord Talbot. How a Frenchman
was taken prisoner (though provided with a safe-conduct) by an
Englishman, who said that buckle-straps were implements of war, and who
was made to arm himself with buckle-straps and nothing else, and meet
the Frenchman, who struck him with a sword in the presence of Talbot.
The other, story is about a man who robbed a church, and who was made to
swear that he would never enter a church again.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Lord Talbot (whom may God pardon) who was, as every one knows, so
victorious as leader of the English, gave in his life two judgments
which were worthy of being related and held in perpetual remembrance,
and in order that the said judgments should be known, I will relate
them briefly in this my first story, though it is the fifth amongst the
others. I will tell it thus.
</p>
<p>
During the time that the cursed and pestilent war prevailed between
France and England, and which has not yet finished, (*) it happened,
as was often the case, that a French soldier was taken prisoner by
an Englishman, and, a ransom having been fixed, he was sent under a
safe-conduct, signed by Lord Talbot, to his captain, that he might
procure his ransom and bring it back to his captor.
</p>
<p>
As he was on his road, he was met by another Englishman, who, seeing he
was a Frenchman, asked him whence he came and whither he was going? The
other told him the truth.
</p>
<p>
"Where is your safe-conduct?" asked the Englishman.
</p>
<p>
"It is not far off," replied the Frenchman. With that he took the
safe-conduct, which was in a little box hung at his belt, and handed
it to the Englishman, who read it from one end to the other. And, as is
customary, there was written on the safe-conduct, "Forbidden to carry
any implements of warfare."
</p>
<p>
The Englishman noted this, and saw that there were <i>esguillettes</i> on
the Frenchman's doublet. (**) He imagined that these straps were real
implements of war, so he said,
</p>
<p>
"I make you my prisoner, because you have broken your safe-conduct."
</p>
<p>
"By my faith, I have not," replied the Frenchman, "saving your grace.
You see in what condition I am."
</p>
<p>
"No! no!" said the Englishman. "By Saint John you have broken your
safe-conduct. Surrender, or I will kill you."
</p>
<p>
The poor Frenchman, who had only his page with him, and was quite
unprovided with weapons, whilst the other was accompanied by three
or four archers, did the best thing he could, and surrendered. The
Englishman led him to a place near there, and put him in prison.
</p>
<pre>
     (*) It had virtually finished, and the English only retained
     the town of Calais when this tale was written (about 1465)
     but they had not relinquished their claim to the French
     Crown, and hostilities were expected to recommence.

     (**) <i>Esguillettes</i> were small straps or laces, used to
     fasten the cuirass to the doublet.
</pre>
<p>
The Frenchman, finding himself thus ill-treated, sent in great haste
to his captain, who when he heard his man's case, was greatly and
marvellously astonished. Thereupon he wrote a letter to Lord Talbot,
and sent it by a herald, to ask how it was that one of his men had
been arrested by one of Lord Talbot's men whilst under that general's
safe-conduct.
</p>
<p>
The said herald, being well instructed as to what he was to say and do,
left his master, and presented the letters to Lord Talbot. He read them,
and caused them to be read also by one of his secretaries before many
knights and squires and others of his followers.
</p>
<p>
Thereupon he flew into a great rage, for he was hot-tempered and
irritable, and brooked not to be disobeyed, and especially in matters of
war; and to question his safe-conduct made him very angry.
</p>
<p>
To shorten the story, he caused to be brought before him both the
Frenchman and the Englishman, and told the Frenchman to tell his tale.
</p>
<p>
He told how he had been taken prisoner by one of Lord Talbot's people,
and put to ransom;
</p>
<p>
"And under your safe-conduct, my lord, I was on my way to my friends to
procure my ransom. I met this gentleman here, who is also one of
your followers, who asked me whither I was going, and if I had a
safe-conduct? I told him, yes, and showed it to him. And when he had
read it he told me that I had broken it, and I replied that I had not,
and that he could not prove it. But he would not listen to me, and I was
forced, if I would not be killed on the spot, to surrender. I know of no
cause why he should have detained me, and I ask justice of you."
</p>
<p>
Lord Talbot, when he had heard the Frenchman, was not well content,
nevertheless when the latter had finished, my Lord turned to the
Englishman and asked,
</p>
<p>
"What have you to reply to this?"
</p>
<p>
"My lord," said he, "it is quite true, as he has said, that I met him
and would see his safe-conduct, which when I had read from end to end, I
soon perceived that he had broken and violated; otherwise I should never
have arrested him."
</p>
<p>
"How had he broken it?" asked Lord Talbot. "Tell me quickly!"
</p>
<p>
"My Lord, because in his safe-conduct he is forbidden all implements of
war, and he had, and has still, real implements of war; that is to say
he has on his doublet, buckle-straps, which are real implements of war,
for without them a man cannot be armed."
</p>
<p>
"Ah!" said Lord Talbot, "and so buckle-straps are implements of war
are they? Do you know of any other way in which he had broken his
safe-conduct?"
</p>
<p>
"Truly, my lord, I do not," replied the Englishman.
</p>
<p>
"What, you villain!" said Lord Talbot. "Have you stopped a gentleman
under my safe-conduct for his buckle-straps? By St. George, I will show
you whether they are implements of war."
</p>
<p>
Then, hot with anger and indignation, he went up to the Frenchman, and
tore from his doublet the two straps, and gave them to the Englishman;
then he put a sword in the Frenchman's hand, and drawing his own good
sword out of the sheath, said to the Englishman,
</p>
<p>
"Defend yourself with that implement of war, as you call it, if you know
how!"
</p>
<p>
Then he said to the Frenchman,
</p>
<p>
"Strike that villain who arrested you without cause or reason, and we
shall see how he can defend himself with this implement of war. If you
spare him, by St. George I will strike you."
</p>
<p>
Thus the Frenchman, whether he would or not, was obliged to strike at
the Englishman with the sword, and the poor Englishman protected himself
as best he could, and ran about the room, with Talbot after him, who
made the Frenchman keep striking the other, and cried out;
</p>
<p>
"Defend yourself, villain, with your implement of war!" In truth, the
Englishman was so well beaten that he was nearly dead, and cried for
mercy to Talbot and the Frenchman. The latter was released from his
ransom by Lord Talbot, and his horse, harness, and all his baggage, were
given back to him.
</p>
<p>
Such was the first judgment of Lord Talbot; there remains to be given an
account of the other, which was thus.
</p>
<p>
He learned that one of his soldiers had robbed a church of the pyx in
which is placed the Corpus Domini, and sold it for ready money&mdash;I
know not for how much, but the pyx was big and fine, and beautifully
enamelled.
</p>
<p>
Lord Talbot, who though he was very brutal and wicked in war, had always
great reverence for the Church, and would never allow a monastery or
church to be set on fire or robbed, heard of this, and he was very
severe on those who broke his regulations.
</p>
<p>
So he caused to be brought before him the man who had stolen the pyx
from the church; and when he came, God knows what a greeting he had.
Talbot would have killed him, if those around had not begged that his
life might be saved. Nevertheless, as he would punish him, he said.
</p>
<p>
"Rascal traitor! why have you dared to rob a church in spite of my
orders?"
</p>
<p>
"Ah, my lord," said the poor thief, "for God's sake have mercy upon me;
I will never do it again."
</p>
<p>
"Come here, villain," said Talbot; and the other came up about as
willingly as though he were going to the gallows. And the said Lord
Talbot rushed at him, and with his fist, which was both large and heavy,
struck him on the head, and cried.
</p>
<p>
"Ha! you thief! have you robbed a church?"
</p>
<p>
And the other cried,
</p>
<p>
"Mercy my lord! I will never do it again."
</p>
<p>
"Will you do it again?"
</p>
<p>
"No, my lord!"
</p>
<p>
"Swear then that you will never again enter a church of any kind. Swear,
villain!"
</p>
<p>
"Very good, my lord," said the other.
</p>
<p>
Then Talbot made the thief swear that he would never set foot in a
church again, which made all who were present and who heard it, laugh,
though they pitied the thief because Lord Talbot had forbidden him
the church for ever, and made him swear never to enter it. Yet we may
believe that he did it with a good motive and intention. Thus you
have heard the two judgments of Lord Talbot, which were such as I have
related to you.

<h2>
    STORY THE SIXTH &mdash; THE DRUNKARD IN PARADISE. <a href="#note-6" name="noteref-6">6</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur de Lannoy
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>The sixth story is of a drunkard, who would confess to the Prior of the
Augustines at the Hague, and after his confession said that he was then
in a holy state and would die; and believed that his head was cut off
and that he was dead, and was carried away by his companions who said
they were going to bury him.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In the city of The Hague in Holland, as the prior of the Augustine
Monastery was one day saying his prayers on the lawn near the chapel of
St. Antony, he was accosted by a great, big Dutchman who was exceedingly
drunk, and who lived in a village called Schevingen, about two leagues
from there.
</p>
<p>
The prior, who saw him coming from afar, guessed his condition by his
heavy and uncertain step, and when they met, the drunkard saluted the
prior, who returned the salute, and passed on reading his prayers,
proposing neither to stop nor question him.
</p>
<p>
The drunkard, being half beside himself, turned and pursued the prior,
and demanded to be confessed.
</p>
<p>
"Confession!" said the prior. "Go away! Go away! You have confessed
already."
</p>
<p>
"Alas, sir," replied the drunkard, "for God's sake confess me. At
present, I remember all my sins, and am most contrite."
</p>
<p>
The prior, displeased to be interrupted by a drunkard, replied.
</p>
<p>
"Go your ways; you have no need of confession, for you are in a very
comfortable case as it is."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, no," said the drunkard, "as sure as death you shall confess me,
master Curé, for I am most devout," and he seized him by the sleeve, and
would have stopped him.
</p>
<p>
The priest would not listen to him, and made wonderful efforts to
escape, but it was no good, for the other was obstinate in his desire to
confess, which the priest would not hear.
</p>
<p>
The devotion of the drunkard increased more and more, and when he saw
that the priest still refused to hear his sins, he put his hand on his
big knife and drew it from its sheath, and told the priest he would kill
him, if he did not listen to his confession.
</p>
<p>
The priest, being afraid of a knife in such dangerous hands, did not
know what to do, so he asked the other,
</p>
<p>
"What is is you want?"
</p>
<p>
"I wish to confess," said he.
</p>
<p>
"Very well; I will hear you," said the priest. "Come here."
</p>
<p>
Our drunkard,&mdash;being more tipsy than a thrush in a vineyard,&mdash;began, so
please you, his devout confession,&mdash;over which I pass, for the priest
never revealed it, but you may guess it was both novel and curious.
</p>
<p>
The priest cut short the wearisome utterances of the drunkard, and gave
him absolution, and, to get rid of him, said;
</p>
<p>
"Go away now; you have made a good confession."
</p>
<p>
"Say you so, sir?" he replied.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, truly," said the priest, "it was a very good confession. Go, and
sin no more!"
</p>
<p>
"Then, since I have well confessed and received absolution, if I were to
die now, should I go to paradise?" asked the drunkard.
</p>
<p>
"Straight! Straight!" replied the priest. "There can be no doubt about
it."
</p>
<p>
"Since that is so," said the drunkard, "and I am now in a holy state, I
would like to die at once, in order that I may go to heaven."
</p>
<p>
With that he took and gave his knife to the priest, begging of him to
cut off his head, in order that he might go to paradise.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, no!" said the priest, much astonished. "It is not my business to do
that&mdash;you must go to heaven by some other means."
</p>
<p>
"No," replied the drunkard, "I wish to go there now, and to die here by
your hands. Come, and kill me."
</p>
<p>
"I will not do that," said the prior. "A priest must not kill any one."
</p>
<p>
"You shall I swear; and if you do not at once despatch me and send me
to heaven I will kill you with my own hands," and at these words
he brandished his big knife before the eyes of the priest, who was
terrified and alarmed.
</p>
<p>
At last, having thought the matter over,&mdash;that he might get rid of this
drunkard, who was becoming more and more aggressive, and perchance might
have taken his life, he seized the knife, and said;
</p>
<p>
"Well! since you wish to die by my hands in order that you may go to
paradise,&mdash;kneel down before me."
</p>
<p>
The words were hardly uttered before the drunkard fell flat, and with
some trouble raised himself to his knees, and with his hands joined
together, awaited the blow of the sword which was to kill him.
</p>
<p>
The priest gave the drunkard a heavy blew with the back of the knife,
which felled him to the ground, where he lay, and would not get up,
believing himself to be in paradise.
</p>
<p>
Then the priest left, not forgetting for his own safety to take the
knife with him, and ere he had gone far he met a waggon full of people
some of whom had been along with the drunkard that day, to whom he
recounted all the story&mdash;begging that they would raise him and convey
him home; he also gave them the knife.
</p>
<p>
They promised to take charge of him, and the priest went away. They had
hardly started on their way, when they perceived the good toper, lying
as though dead, with his face to the ground; and when they were nigh
to him, they all with one voice shouted his name,&mdash;but, shout as they
would, he made no reply. Then they cried out again, but it was no use.
</p>
<p>
Then some of them descended from the waggon, and they took him by the
head, and the feet, and the legs, and raised him from the ground, and so
shook him that he opened his eyes and said,
</p>
<p>
"Leave me alone! Leave me alone! I am dead!"
</p>
<p>
"No, you are not," said his companions. "You must come along with us."
</p>
<p>
"I will not," said the drunkard. "Where should I go? I am dead, and
already in heaven."
</p>
<p>
"You must come," said the others. "We will get some drink."
</p>
<p>
"Drink?" said the other. "I shall never drink again; I am dead;" and for
all that his comrades could say or do, they could not get it out of his
head but that he was dead.
</p>
<p>
The dispute lasted long, and they could not persuade the drunkard to
accompany them; for to all that they said he always replied, "I am
dead".
</p>
<p>
At last one of them bethought himself, and said,
</p>
<p>
"Then since you are dead, you must not lie here and be buried like a
beast of the field. Come! come along with us, and we will carry you
in our waggon to the grave-yard of our town as befits a Christian.
Otherwise you will not go to heaven."
</p>
<p>
When the drunkard heard that he must be buried in order that he might
go to heaven, he was satisfied to obey, so he was soon tucked up in
the waggon, where he was quickly asleep. The waggon was drawn by good
cattle, and they were speedily at Schevingen, where the good drunkard was
put down in front of his house. His wife and servants were called, and
the body given to them, for he slept so soundly that he was carried
from the waggon to the house and put in his bed without ever waking, and
being laid between the sheets, at last woke up two days later.

<h2>
    STORY THE SEVENTH &mdash; THE WAGGONER IN THE BEAR.
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a goldsmith of Paris who made a waggoner sleep with him and his
wife, and how the waggoner dallied with her from behind, which the
goldsmith perceived and discovered, and of the words which he spake to
the waggoner.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A goldsmith of Paris, once, in order to complete some of his wares in
time for the fair of Lendit, laid in a large stock of willow charcoal.
It happened one day amongst others, that the waggoner who delivered this
charcoal, knowing that the goldsmith was in great haste, brought two
waggons more than he had on any previous day, but hardly had he entered
Paris with the last load than the city gates were shut on his heels.
Nevertheless, he was well received by the goldsmith, and after the
charcoal was unloaded, and the horses stabled, they all supped at their
leisure, and made great cheer, and drank heavily. Just as the meal
finished the clock struck midnight, which astonished them greatly, so
quickly had the time passed at supper.
</p>
<p>
Each one thanked God, and being heavy-eyed, only asked to go to bed, but
as it was so late, the goldsmith detained the waggoner, fearing that he
might meet the watch, who would have put him into the Châtelet had they
found him at that hour of the night.
</p>
<p>
At that time the goldsmith had many persons working for him, and he was
obliged to make the waggoner lie with him and his wife, and, not
being of a suspicions nature, he made his wife lie between him and the
waggoner.
</p>
<p>
He had great trouble to arrange this, for the good waggoner refused his
hospitality, and would rather have slept in the barn or stable, but he
was obliged to obey the goldsmith. And after he had undressed, he got
into bed, in which already were the goldsmith and his wife, as I have
already said.
</p>
<p>
The wife feeling the waggoner approach her, moved nearer her husband,
both on account of the cold and the smallness of the bed, and, instead
of a pillow, placed her head upon her husband's breast, whilst her
backside rested on the waggoner's knees.
</p>
<p>
Our goldsmith soon went to sleep, and his wife pretended to also,
and the waggoner, being tired from his work, did the same. But as
the stallion grows hot as soon as he approaches the mare, so did this
stallion lift up his head on feeling so near to him the aforesaid woman.
</p>
<p>
It was not within the power of the waggoner to refrain from attacking
her closely; and this lasted for some time without the woman waking, or
at least pretending to wake. Nor would the husband have awaked, had it
not been that the head of his wife reclined on his breast, and owing to
the assault of this stallion, gave him such a bump that he quickly woke.
</p>
<p>
He thought at first that his wife was dreaming, but as her dream
continued, and he heard the waggoner moving about and breathing hard,
he gently put down his hand, and found what ravage the stallion of the
waggoner was making in his warren;&mdash;at which, as he loved his wife, he
was not well content. He soon made the waggoner with draw, and said to
him,
</p>
<p>
"What are you doing, you wicked rascal? You must be mad to attack my
wife in that way. Don't do it again! Morbleu! I declare to you that if
she had woke just now when your machine was pushing her, I don't know
what she would have done; but I feel certain, as I know her well, that
she would have scratched your face, and torn out your eyes with her
nails. You don't know what she will do when she loses her temper, and
there is nothing in the world which puts her out more. Take it away, I
beg, for your own sake."
</p>
<p>
The waggoner, in a few words, declared that it was unintentional, and,
as day was breaking, he rose and took his leave and went away with his
cart.
</p>
<p>
You may fancy that the good woman on whom the waggoner made this attempt
was displeased in another way than her husband fancied; and afterwards
it was said that the waggoner met her in the proper way: but I would not
believe it or credit the report.

<h2>
    STORY THE EIGHTH &mdash; TIT FOR TAT. <a href="#note-8" name="noteref-8">8</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur de la Roche
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a youth of Picardy who lived at Brussels, and made his master's
daughter pregnant, and for that cause left and came back to Picardy to
be married. And soon after his departure the girl's mother perceived the
condition of her daughter, and the girl confessed in what state she was;
so her mother sent her to the Picardian to tell him that he must undo
that which he had done. And how his new bride refused then to sleep with
him, and of the story she told him, whereupon he immediately left her
and returned to his first love, and married her.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In the city of Brussels, where a good many adventures have happened in
our time, there lived not long ago a young man of Picardy, who served
his master well and faithfully for a long period. And amongst other
services which he did the said master was this; that by his civil
speech, bearing, and courtesy he so gained the graces of his master's
daughter, that he lay with her, and owing to his meritorious actions she
became pregnant.
</p>
<p>
The youth, knowing the lady was in that condition, was not such a fool
as to wait until his master should perceive and know it. So he quickly
asked leave to absent himself for a few days,&mdash;albeit he had no
intention to return&mdash;pretending that he must go to Picardy to see his
father and mother, and some others of his relations.
</p>
<p>
Then he took farewell of his master and mistress, and had a most
piteous leave-taking with the daughter; to whom he promised quickly to
return,&mdash;which he did not, and for good cause.
</p>
<p>
When he was in Picardy, at the house of his father, his master's
daughter grew so big with child that her sad condition could no longer
be concealed; amongst others, her worthy mother, who was experienced in
such matters, was the first to notice it. She took her daughter on one
side, and asked her how she came to be in that condition, and who was
the cause of it. The girl had to be much pressed and scolded before she
would say anything, but at last was forced to confess her sad condition,
and own that it was the Picardian, who, a short while before, had been
servant to her father, who had seduced her, and left her in that pitiful
case.
</p>
<p>
Her mother was furious, and abused her till she could say no more, which
the poor girl bore so patiently and without saying a word, that it was
enough to excuse her for letting herself be put in the family-way by the
Picardian.
</p>
<p>
But alas! her patient endurance had no effect upon her mother, who said;
</p>
<p>
"Go away! go away! disgraceful hussy! and do your best to find the man
who made you pregnant, and tell him to undo that which he has done!
Never come back to me till he has undone the wrong he has done you."
</p>
<p>
The poor girl, who was in the condition you have heard, was crushed and
overcome by the wrath of her cruel mother, and set out in search of the
young man who had ruined her; and you may well imagine, had to endure
much trouble and pain before she could hear any news of him.
</p>
<p>
But at last, as God so willed it, after much wandering about through
Picardy, she came, one Sunday, to a large village in the county of
Artois, and she came most opportunely, for on that day her friend, the
Picardian who had deceived her, was to be married, at which she was very
joyful. And she cared so little about obeying her mother, that, big as
she was, she pressed amongst the crowd, and when she saw her lover, she
saluted him. He, when he saw her, blushed, and returned her salutation,
and said to her;
</p>
<p>
"You are very welcome! What brings you here at this time, my dear?"
</p>
<p>
"My mother," she replied, "sent me to you, and God knows that you have
caused me much upbraiding. She charged and commanded me that I should
tell you that you must undo that which you have done, or, if you do not,
I am never to go back to her."
</p>
<p>
The other, when he heard this, to get rid of her as soon as he could,
spoke as follows.
</p>
<p>
"My dear, I will willingly do that which you ask and your mother
requires me to do, for it is very reasonable, but at this moment I
cannot be seen talking to you. I beg of you to have patience for to-day,
and to-morrow I will attend to your request."
</p>
<p>
With that she was content, and then he caused her to be taken and put
in a fair chamber, and commanded that she should be well-treated, as she
deserved to be, after the great trouble and difficulty she had had in
seeking him out.
</p>
<p>
Now you must know that the bride had kept her eyes open, and when she
saw her husband talking to a woman big with child, she had misgivings,
and was by no means satisfied, but much troubled and vexed in mind.
</p>
<p>
She nursed her wrath, and said nothing until her husband came to bed.
And when he would have cuddled and kissed her, and done his proper duty
as a husband, and so earned his "caudle", (*) she turned herself first
on one side and then on the other, so that he could not attain his
purpose, at which he was greatly astonished and angry, and said to her,
</p>
<pre>
     (*) It was the custom in the Middle Ages to bring in the
     middle of the wedding night, a caudle of hot milk, soup, or
     spiced wine to the married couple.
</pre>
<p>
"Why do you do that, my dear?"
</p>
<p>
"I have good cause," she replied, "for I see from your acts that you do
not care for me. There are many others you like better than me."
</p>
<p>
"By my faith," said he, "there is no woman in the world I love better
than you."
</p>
<p>
"Ah!" she said, "did I not see you after dinner holding discourse for a
long time with a woman who was in the room! I saw you only too plainly,
and you cannot excuse yourself."
</p>
<p>
"By our Lady," he replied, "you have no cause to be jealous about her,"
and with that he told her that it was the daughter of his master at
Brussels, and how he had lain with her and made her pregnant, and on
that account he had left the place; and how also after his departure,
she became so big with child that it was perceived, and then she had
confessed to her mother who had seduced her, and her mother had sent her
to him that he might undo that which he had done, or else she must never
return home.
</p>
<p>
When the young man had finished his story, his wife who had been struck
by one portion of it, said;
</p>
<p>
"What? Do you say that she told her mother you had slept with her?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," he said; "she made it all known to her."
</p>
<p>
"On my word!" she replied, "then she proved herself very stupid. The
waggoner at our house slept with me more than forty nights, but you
don't suppose that I breathed a word of that to my mother. I took good
care to say nothing."
</p>
<p>
"Truly," quoth he, "the devil takes care that the gibbet is not cheated.
(**) Go back to your waggoner if you like; for I care nothing for you."
</p>
<pre>
     (**) In other words, we are punished for our ill-deeds.
</pre>
<p>
Thereupon he arose and went to the woman he had seduced, and left the
other one; and when the morning came and this news was noised abroad,
God knows that it amused many and displeased many others, especially the
father and mother of the bride.

<h2>
    STORY THE NINTH &mdash; THE HUSBAND PANDAR TO HIS OWN WIFE. <a href="#note-9" name="noteref-9">9</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a knight of Burgundy, who was marvellously amorous of one of his
wife's waiting women, and thinking to sleep with her, slept with his
wife who was in the bed of the said tire-woman. And how he caused, by
his order, another knight, his neighbour to sleep with the said woman,
believing that it was really the tirewoman&mdash;and afterwards he was not
well pleased, albeit that the lady knew nothing, and was not aware, I
believe, that she had had to do with aught other than her own husband.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In order to properly continue these stories, the incidents of which
happen in divers places and under various circumstances, there should
not be omitted the tale of a gentle knight of Burgundy, who lived in
a castle of his own that was fair and strong, and well provided with
retainers and artillery, as his condition required.
</p>
<p>
He fell in love with a fair damsel of his household, who was chief
tire-woman to his wife, and his great affection for her took such
hold upon him that he could not be happy without her, and was always
conversing with her and beseeching her, and, in short, life seemed no
good without her, so filled with love of her was he.
</p>
<p>
The girl, being chaste and prudent, wished to keep her honour, which she
valued as she did her own soul, and would not betray the duty she owed
to her mistress, and therefore she lent no ear to her master when he
importuned her. And whenever he spoke to her, God knows what a rebuff
he met, and how she remonstrated with him as to his boldness and
ill-conduct. Moreover, she told him that if he continued she would
inform her mistress.
</p>
<p>
But, in spite of her threats, he would not abandon the enterprise, but
pursued her more and more, so that at last the girl was forced to tell
her mistress.
</p>
<p>
The lady being informed of her lord's love affair, though she did not
show it, was not well pleased; but she devised a plan, which was this.
</p>
<p>
She charged the girl that the next time the knight solicited her, that
she should lay aside all reserve, and inform him that on the following
night she would expect him in her chamber and in her bed; "And if he
should accept the rendezvous," added the lady; "I will take your place;
and leave the rest to me."
</p>
<p>
The girl was pleased to obey her mistress, as was her duty, and promised
she would do as she was bid.
</p>
<p>
It was not long before my lord again returned to the charge, and prayed
her more warmly than before, saying that if she did not grant his
prayer, he would rather die than live longer in this hopeless passion.
</p>
<p>
What need is there of a long story? The girl, being thoroughly
well-instructed by her mistress, appointed an hour at which he should
come to her the next night, at which he was so well-pleased that his
heart leapt for joy, and he promised himself that he would not fail to
be there.
</p>
<p>
The desired day arrived, but in the evening, a gentle knight, a
neighbour of my lord and his great friend, came to see him, for whom my
lord made, as he well knew how, great cheer; as did my lady also, and
the rest of the household were not behind-hand, knowing that to be the
good pleasure of my lord and my lady.
</p>
<p>
After much feasting and a supper and a banquet, it was time to retire
to rest, and having said good-night to the lady and her women, the two
knights began to talk over various matters, and, amongst other
things, the visitor asked my lord if there were any pretty women with
shoulder-knots in the village, (*) for the weather being fine, and
having made good cheer, he had a desire for a woman.
</p>
<pre>
     (*) In some towns of the south of France, in the Middle
     Ages, the courtesans used to wear a knot of coloured ribbon
     on the shoulder.
</pre>
<p>
My lord, on account of the great love he bore his friend, would hide
nothing from him, and told him how he had that night agreed to sleep
with the tire-woman; and that he might do his friend pleasure, when he
had been with her a certain time, he would, he said, rise gently, and go
away, and let the visitor do the rest.
</p>
<p>
The visitor thanked his host, and God knows that the hour seemed long in
coming. At last the host took leave of his guest, and went to his room,
as was his custom, to undress.
</p>
<p>
Now you must know that whilst the knights were talking, my lady went to
the bed in which my lord expected to find the tiring-maid, and there she
awaited whatever God might be pleased to send her.
</p>
<p>
My lord was a long time undressing, to give time to his wife to go to
sleep. He then dismissed his valet, and in his long dressing-gown went
to where his lady awaited him,&mdash;he thinking to find some-one else,&mdash;and
silently undressed and got into bed.
</p>
<p>
And as the candle was put out, and the lady uttered no word, he believed
he was with the woman. Hardly had he got into bed before he began to
perform his duty, and so well did he acquit himself, that three, even
four, times did not content him; whereat his wife felt great pleasure,
and thinking that that was all, fell asleep.
</p>
<p>
My lord, now much lighter than when he came, seeing that the lady slept,
and remembering his promise, rose quietly and went to his friend, who
was awaiting orders to go into action, and told him to take his place,
but that he must not speak a word, and must come away when he had done
all that he wished.
</p>
<p>
The other, as wide-awake as a rat, and straining at the leash like a
greyhound,&mdash;went, and lay down by the lady without her knowing of it.
And though he felt assured that my lord had already worked well, and
he was in haste, he did better, at which my lady was in no small degree
astonished, and after this amusement&mdash;which was not distasteful to
her&mdash;she again fell asleep.
</p>
<p>
Then the good knight left her, and returned to my lord, who again
resumed his place by my lady's side as before, and made a fresh attack
upon her&mdash;so well did the exercise please him.
</p>
<p>
Thus the hours passed,&mdash;either in sleeping or doing something
else,&mdash;until day broke; and as he turned round in bed, expecting
to behold the tire-woman, he saw and knew that it was his wife, who
thereupon said to him.
</p>
<p>
"Are you not a recreant, cowardly, and wicked whoremonger? You thought
to have had my tire-woman, and it is upon me that you have so many times
essayed your unbridled and measureless lust. Thank God you have been
deceived, for no one else shall ever have that which belongs to me."
</p>
<p>
The good knight was both astonished and angry, and no wonder. And when
he spoke at last, he said.
</p>
<p>
"My dear, I cannot hide from you my folly, and I greatly grieve ever to
have undertaken such an enterprise. I beg of you to be satisfied with
what you have done, and never mention it for never in all my life shall
it occur again. That I promise you on my honour; and that you may never
have occasion to be reminded of it, I will send away the woman who has
played this trick upon me."
</p>
<p>
The lady, who was more satisfied with this adventure than her woman, and
seeing how contrite her husband was, allowed herself to be gained-over,
but not without making some remonstrances and scoldings.
</p>
<p>
In the end, all was arranged satisfactorily, but the knight, who had a
flea in his ear, as soon as he rose, went to his companion, to whom
he related the adventure at full length, and demanded from him two
promises; the first was that he should strictly promise to say nothing
of the matter, and the second that he should never meet his wife again.
</p>
<p>
The other, who was much vexed at this unfortunate affair, comforted the
knight as best he could, and promised to perform his very reasonable
requests; then mounted his horse and rode off. The tire-woman, who was
not to blame for the <i>contretemps</i>, bore the punishment however, and was
sent away. The knight and the lady lived long together without her ever
being aware that she had had to do with a strange knight.

<h2>
    STORY THE TENTH &mdash; THE EEL PASTIES. <a href="#note-10" name="noteref-10">10</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur de la Roche
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a knight of England, who, after he was married, wished his mignon to
procure him some pretty girls, as he did before; which the mignon would
not do, saying that one wife sufficed; but the said knight brought him
back to obedience by causing eel pasties to be always served to him,
both at dinner and at supper.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Many wonderful and curious adventures have occurred in England, though
their recital would be out of place amongst these tales. Nevertheless,
the present story is appropriate to be told here to increase the number
of these tales, and is of a great lord of the kingdom of England, who
was very rich and powerful, and who, amongst all his servitors, had
especial trust, confidence, and affection in a young gentleman of his
household, and that for various reasons. And because of his loyalty,
diligence, cunning, and prudence, and other good qualities he found in
him, he hid from him nothing concerning his love-affairs.
</p>
<p>
As time went on, the said young gentleman, by his cleverness, grew
so much in his master's favour, that he not only knew his master's
love-affairs, but acted as emissary and go-between on every occasion, as
long as his master was unmarried.
</p>
<p>
But a certain time after that, it happened that by the advice of
his relatives, friends, and well-wishers, my lord was married to a
beautiful, noble, good, and rich lady, much to the joy of many persons;
and amongst other our <i>mignon</i> was not the least joyful, as he said to
himself that the marriage would be to his master's welfare and honour,
and would cause him he hoped to cease from those pleasures of love which
he had hitherto practised.
</p>
<p>
One day he told the lord how glad he was that he had married a fair and
good lady, for now he would not need to have women sought for him as
before. To which my lord replied that nevertheless he did not intend
to abandon all his love-affairs, and although he was married would
sometimes employ the young man's services.
</p>
<p>
The youth was not pleased to hear this, and replied that such amours
should cease now that his love was shared by a lady who excelled all
others in beauty, prudence, and goodness.
</p>
<p>
"Do as you please, my lord," said he, "but, for my part, I will never
carry a message to any woman if it is to prejudice my mistress."
</p>
<p>
"I know not what you mean by prejudice," said his master, "but you must
prepare to go to such and such ladies. For I would have you know that
your duties will be as they were before."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, my lord," said the youth, "it seems that you take a pleasure in
abusing women, which is not right; for you know well that all those
you have named are not to be compared in beauty or other respects to my
lady, to whom you are offering a deadly insult if she should ever hear
of your misconduct. And what is more, you cannot be ignorant that in so
doing you damn your own soul."
</p>
<p>
"Cease your preaching," said my lord, "and do as I command."
</p>
<p>
"Pardon me, my lord," said the youth. "I would rather die than, through
my means, trouble should arise between you and my lady; and I beg of you
to be satisfied with me as I am, for certainly I will no more act as I
once used."
</p>
<p>
My lord, who saw how obstinate the young man was, pressed him no more
at that time. But three or four days after that, without alluding to the
conversation they had had, he demanded of the young man, amongst other
things, what dish he preferred, and he replied that no dish pleased him
so much as eel pasties.
</p>
<p>
"By St. John, it is a good dish," said his master; "you have not chosen
badly."
</p>
<p>
That being said, my lord retired, and caused to be sent to him his
major-domo, whom he charged by his obedience that he should serve to the
young man nothing but eel pasties, whatsoever he might say or do; and
the major-domo promised to perform his commands, which he did, for on
the same day, as the said youth was seated at table in his chamber, his
servant brought unto him many fair and large eel pasties which had been
delivered to him from the kitchen,&mdash;at which he was pleased, and ate his
fill.
</p>
<p>
On the morrow it was the same, and the five or six following days he was
brought like pasties, of which he was already weary. So the youth asked
of his servants why they brought him nothing but these pasties?
</p>
<p>
"By my faith, sir," they replied, "they will give us nothing else. We
see very well that they send to the hall and elsewhere, other meats; but
for you there is nothing but pasties."
</p>
<p>
The young man, being wise and prudent, and caring little for his
stomach, made no complaint, and several days passed; during which he
was still served with these everlasting pies, at which he was not best
pleased.
</p>
<p>
One day he determined to go and dine with the stewards, where he was
served as before with eel pasties. And when he saw that, he could not
help asking why they served him differently to the others.
</p>
<p>
"God's death!" quoth he, "I am so stuffed that I can eat no more. It
seems to me that I see nothing but eel pies. Let me tell you there is no
sense in it,&mdash;you carry the joke too far. For more than a month you have
played this trick upon me. I am so worn-out that I have neither health
nor strength. I do not like to be treated in this manner."
</p>
<p>
The stewards told him that they only did as their master had bidden
them, and that it was not their own doing. The young man, wearied of
these pies, determined to complain to my lord, and ask him why he had
caused the eel pies to be always served, and forbidden the cooks to
supply any other dish.
</p>
<p>
In reply, my lord said unto him, "Did you not tell me that eel pie was
the dish that you most liked in all the world?"
</p>
<p>
"By St. John, yes, my lord," said the youth.
</p>
<p>
"Then why do you complain now," said my lord, "since I cause you to be
served with that which you like?"
</p>
<p>
"I like them," replied the young man, "in moderation. I like exceedingly
to have eel pies once, or twice, or three times, or now and then, and
there is no dish I love better. But to eat it always, and nothing else
beside,&mdash;by Our Lady I will not. Any man would be sick and weary. My
stomach is so sick of eel pasties, that the moment I smell them I have
already dined. For God's sake, my lord, command that I be given some
other food that I may recover my appetite; otherwise I am a dead man."
"Ah!" said my lord, "Yet it seems that you do not think I shall be a
dead man if I content myself with the charms of my wife. By my soul, you
may believe that I am as weary of them as you are of the pasties,
and would as willingly have a change,&mdash;though there is none I love
so much&mdash;as you desire another dish, though you like pasties best. In
short, you shall eat no other food until you consent to serve me as you
did before, and bring me a variety of women,&mdash;even as you would have a
variety of dishes."
</p>
<p>
The young man, when he heard this subtle comparison, was confused, and
promised his master that he would do all that was desired, if he
could but be quit of his pasties, and would carry messages and conduct
intrigues as before. And from that time forth my lord, to spare my lady,
and by the good help of his <i>mignon</i>, passed his time with fair and
honest damsels, and the young man was relieved of his eel pasties, and
restored to his old office.

<h2>
    STORY THE ELEVENTH &mdash; A SACRIFICE TO THE DEVIL. <a href="#note-11" name="noteref-11">11</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a jealous rogue, who after many offerings made to divers saints to
curé him of his jealousy, offered a candle to the devil who is usually
painted under the feet of St. Michael; and of the dream that he had and
what happened to him when he awoke.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A cowardly, jealous old hunks (I will not say that he was a cuckold)
knew not to whom to have recourse to be cured of his jealous grief and
misery. To-day he would make one pilgrimage, and to-morrow another,
and often would send his servants to perform his devotions and make
offerings whilst he was seated in his house to look after his wife, who
passed her time miserably with the most cursed husband and suspicious
grumbler that ever woman married.
</p>
<p>
One day, as he thought of the many offerings that he had made or was to
make to the various saints in heaven and amongst others to St. Michael,
he bethought him that he would make one to the figure that is under the
feet of the said St. Michael.
</p>
<p>
With that he commanded one of his servants to light and bring a large
wax candle, and offer it on his behalf. Soon it was reported to him that
his orders had been obeyed.
</p>
<p>
"Thus," said he to himself, "I shall see if God or the devil can cure
me," and in his usual ill-temper he went to bed with his good and honest
wife, and perhaps because he had so many fancies and whims in his head
that nature was restrained, she lay in peace.
</p>
<p>
In fact he slept soundly, and when he was in the depth of his sleep,
he to whom the candle had that day been offered, appeared unto him in
a vision, and thanked him for his offering, declaring that such a
sacrifice had never before been made to him. Moreover, he told the man
that he had not lost his labour, and should obtain his request, and
whilst the other lay still in deep sleep, it seemed to him that a ring
was placed on his finger, and he was told that whilst that ring was on
his finger he should never be jealous or have any cause for jealousy.
</p>
<p>
After the vision had vanished, our jealous hunks awoke, and expected to
find on his finger the said ring, and found that one of his fingers
was in the backside of his wife, at which both he and she were much
astonished.
</p>
<p>
But of the rest of the life of this jealous fool, and of his business
and condition, this story is silent.

<h2>
    STORY THE TWELFTH &mdash; THE CALF. <a href="#note-12" name="noteref-12">12</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur de la Roche
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a Dutchman, who at all hours of the day and night ceased not to
dally with his wife in love sports; and how it chanced that he laid her
down, as they went through a wood, under a great tree in which was a
labourer who had lost his calf. And as he was enumerating the charms of
his wife, and naming all the pretty things he could see, the labourer
asked him if he could not see the calf he sought, to which the Dutchman
replied that he thought he could see a tail.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In the borders of Holland there formerly lived a foolish fellow, who
determined to do the worst thing he could&mdash;that is, get married. And so
entranced was he with the joys of wedlock, that although it was winter,
he was so heated that the night&mdash;which at that season was nine or ten
hours&mdash;was not sufficiently long to enable him to appease the ardent
desires which he felt.
</p>
<p>
Wherever he met his wife he put her on her back; whether it was in the
chamber, or in the stable, or any other place, he always attacked her.
And this did not last only one or two months, but longer than I care to
tell, for it would not be convenient that many women should hear of the
zeal of this insatiable worker. What more shall I say? He performed
so often that his memory has never been forgotten, or will be, in that
country. And in truth the woman who formerly complained to the Bailli of
Amiens had not such good cause as this man's wife, but, notwithstanding
that she could often have dispensed with this pleasant task she was
always obedient to her husband, and never restive under the spur.
</p>
<p>
It chanced one day, after dinner, when the weather was very fine, and
the sun shot its rays over the flower-embroidered earth, that the fancy
came to this man and his wife that they two would go alone to the woods,
and they started on their road.
</p>
<p>
Now, in order that you may learn my story, let me tell you that exactly
at the same time as these good folk went forth to play in the wood, it
chanced that a labourer had lost his calf, which he had put to graze in
a field at the edge of the wood; but when he came to search for his calf
he could not find it, at which he was sad at heart.
</p>
<p>
So he set out to search for the said calf both in the wood and in the
fields, and the places round about, to gather news of it.
</p>
<p>
He bethought him that perchance it might have wandered into some thicket
to graze, or to some grassy ditch which it would not leave till it had
filled its belly; and to the end that he might the better see, without
running hither and thither, whether his surmise was right, he chose the
highest and thickest tree that he could find, and climbed into it, and
when he had climbed to the top of his tree, from whence he could see all
the adjacent fields and wood, he was sure that he was half-way towards
finding his calf.
</p>
<p>
Whilst the honest fellow was casting his eyes on all sides to find
his calf, there came through the wood our man and his wife, singing,
playing, and rejoicing, as light hearts will do in a pleasant place. Nor
was it wonderful that the desire came to him to tumble his wife in such
a pleasant and suitable place, and looking now to the right now to the
left for a spot where he might conveniently take his pleasure, he saw
the big tree in which was the labourer&mdash;though he knew it not&mdash;and under
that tree he prepared to accomplish his pleasant purposes.
</p>
<p>
And when he came to that place, his desires soon inflamed him, and he
waited not to begin his work, but attacked his wife and threw her on the
ground, for at that time he was very merry and his wife also.
</p>
<p>
He would fain see her both before and behind, and for that reason took
off her dress, so that she was only in her petticoat, and that he pulled
up very high in spite of her efforts, and that he might the better see
at his ease her beauties, he turned her this way and that, and three
or four times did his strong hand fall upon her big buttocks. Then he
turned her on the other side, and as he had regarded her backside,
so did he her front, to which the good, honest woman would in no wise
consent, and besides the resistance that she made, her tongue was not
idle.
</p>
<p>
She called him "ungracious", "a fool", "a madman", "disgusting", and
many other things, but it was no good; he was stronger than she was,
and would make an inventory of all her charms, and she was forced to
let him,&mdash;preferring, like a wise woman, to please her husband, than to
annoy him by a refusal.
</p>
<p>
Having broken down all her defences, this valiant man feasted his eyes
on her front part, and, shame to say, was not content until his hands
had revealed to his eyes all the secrets for which he searched.
</p>
<p>
And as he was profoundly studying her body, he would say, "I see this!
I see that! Now again this! Now again that!" until whosoever heard him
would have thought he saw all the world and much beside. And, finally,
after a long and thorough examination, he cried, "Holy Mary! what a lot
of things I see!"
</p>
<p>
"Alas, good people," then said the labourer in the tree; "you do not
happen to see my calf? It seems to me, sir, that I can see its tail."
</p>
<p>
The other was much vexed and astonished, and replied quickly,
</p>
<p>
"That tail is not the tail of your calf," and with that he walked away,
and his wife after him.
</p>
<p>
If it should be asked what moved the labourer to put that question, the
writer of this story would reply that the hair in front of this woman
was very long and thick, as is usual with the Dutch women, and he might
well have thought it was the tail of his calf, and as also her husband
was saying that he could see so many things&mdash;nearly everything there was
in the world&mdash;the labourer thought to himself that the calf could hardly
be far off, but might be hidden inside along with the other things.

<h2>
    STORY THE THIRTEENTH &mdash; THE CASTRATED CLERK. <a href="#note-13" name="noteref-13">13</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur L'amant De Brucelles.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>How a lawyer's clerk in England deceived his master making him believe
that he had no testicles, by which reason he had charge over his
mistress both in the country and in the town, and enjoyed his pleasure.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
At London, in England, there formerly lived a lawyer, who, amongst his
other servitors, had a clerk who was clever, and diligent, wrote well,
and was a handsome lad, and was, moreover, let it be stated, as cunning
as any man of his age.
</p>
<p>
This gentle and lusty clerk was much smitten with his mistress,&mdash;a
beautiful, kind, and gentle dame&mdash;who so much admired him that if ever
he had but dared to reveal his affection, the god of love would have led
her to confess that he was the only man on earth who pleased her.
</p>
<p>
It chanced that once, being in a suitable place, and all fear being
laid aside, he recounted unto the said lady his sad, but not unpleasant,
case; and she by the great courtesy which God had not forgotten to give
her, being already touched as has before been said, did not long delay;
for after she had addressed to him many excuses and remonstrances, she
was glad to let him know that he pleased her well.
</p>
<p>
The other,&mdash;who was no fool&mdash;was more joyed than he had ever been, and
determined to hammer the iron while it was hot, and so warmly pursued
her, that ere long he enjoyed her love.
</p>
<p>
The love of the mistress for the clerk, and of the clerk for the
mistress, was for a long time so ardent, that never were people more
taken with each other; for not seldom did they forget to eat and drink,
and it would not have been in the power of Malbouche or Dangier (*) nor
other such cursed sprites, to have disturbed their happiness.
</p>
<pre>
     (*) Allegorical personages, typifying slander and jealousy,
     mentioned in the Romaunt de la Rose.
</pre>
<p>
In this joyous state and pleasant pastime, they passed many days such
as are rarely given to lovers, and so fond were they of each other, that
they would almost have renounced their share of paradise, to live in the
world in that condition.
</p>
<p>
It chanced one day they were together, talking of the great affection
they bore each other, and devising how they could safely continue to
take their pleasure without some inkling of their dangerous pastime
being known to her husband, who was as jealous as a man could be.
</p>
<p>
You may fancy that more than one idea occurred to them, which I here
pass over, but the final conclusion and supreme resolution of the good
clerk, was to vow to act carefully and bring his undertaking to a lucky
termination,&mdash;in which he failed not, and this is how he accomplished
his end.
</p>
<p>
You must know that while the clerk was on intimate and friendly terms
with his mistress, and diligently served and pleased her, he was at
the same time not less diligent to serve and please his master, that
he might the better conceal his own faults and blind the eyes of the
jealous husband, who little suspected what was being prepared for him.
</p>
<p>
One day soon after, our clerk, seeing that his master was well satisfied
with him, spoke to him when he was alone, most humbly, softly, and with
great respect, and told him that he had a great secret which he would
willingly reveal if he dared.
</p>
<p>
And, it must be told, that like women, who have tears at their command
and can shed them whenever they like, our clerk, whilst he spoke, let
fall from his eyes tears in great abundance,&mdash;which any man would have
taken to be signs of sorrow, pity, and honest purpose.
</p>
<p>
When the poor abused master heard his clerk, he was much astonished, and
said,
</p>
<p>
"What is the matter, my son, and why do you weep?"
</p>
<p>
"Alas, sir, I have much more cause than anyone else to be sorrowful,
but my case is so strange, and not the less pitiful, that it should be
hidden; nevertheless I have determined to tell you, if I can lay aside
the fear which for long has haunted me."
</p>
<p>
"Do not weep, my son," replied his master, "and tell me what it is, and
I assure you that if it is possible for me to aid, you I will willingly
give you all the assistance I can."
</p>
<p>
"Master," said the cunning clerk, "I thank you; but I have thought the
matter over, and I do not think my tongue will be able to relate the
great misfortune that I have long time borne."
</p>
<p>
"Leave all your grief and pratings," replied the master. "Nothing ought
to be hidden from me, as your master, and I wish to know what is the
matter; therefore come here and tell me."
</p>
<p>
The clerk, who knew the length of his master's foot, had to be much
entreated, and pretended to be in great fear, and shed great abundance
of tears before he would accede and say what he had to say, and then
made his master promise that he would reveal the secret to no man, for
he would rather die than have his misfortune known.
</p>
<p>
The master having given this promise, the clerk&mdash;pale, and trembling
like a man who was going to be hanged&mdash;told his story.
</p>
<p>
"My most worthy master, I know that all people, and you amongst them,
imagine that I am a natural man like any other, capable of having
connexion with a woman, and creating children; but I affirm and can
prove that I am not such&mdash;to my great sorrow, alas."
</p>
<p>
And with these words he pulled out his member and showed his bag. He
had with much time and trouble pushed up his testicles towards his lower
belly, and so well concealed them that it seemed as though he had none.
Then he said,
</p>
<p>
"Master, you now know my misfortune, which I again beg of you not to let
be known, and, moreover, I humbly beg of you by all the services I have
ever rendered,&mdash;which would have been greater if my power had equalled
my will&mdash;that you will allow me to pass the rest of my life in some holy
monastery, where I may spend my time in the service of God, for I am of
no use in the world."
</p>
<p>
His worthy and much-abused master discoursed unto him of the austerities
of a religious life, and how little merit there was in becoming a monk
out of grief for a misfortune, and by many other means, too numerous to
recount here, prevailed on him to renounce his intention. And you must
know, moreover, that he would on no account lose his clerk, on account
of his skill in writing, and diligence, and the use he intended to make
of him. What need to say more? He so remonstrated that the clerk, in
short, promised to remain for a further time in his service. And as the
clerk had revealed his secret, so also did the master lay bare his own
heart, and said;
</p>
<p>
"My son, I am not glad to hear of your misfortune; but in the end God
orders all things for the best, and knows what is most suitable for us.
You can in future serve me well, and merit all that is in my power to do
for you. I have a young wife, who is light-hearted and flighty, and I am
old and staid; which might give occasion to some to dishonour me and her
also, if she should prove other than chaste, and afford me matter for
jealousy, and many other things. I entrust her to you that you may watch
over her, and I beg of you to guard her so that I may have no reason to
be jealous."
</p>
<p>
After long deliberation, the clerk gave his reply, and when he spoke,
God knows how he praised his most fair and kind mistress, saying that
she excelled all others in beauty and goodness, of that he was sure.
Nevertheless, that service or any other he would perform with all his
heart, and never leave her whatever might happen, but inform his master
of all that occurred, as a good servant should.
</p>
<p>
The master, pleased and joyful at the new guardian he had found for his
wife, left the house, and went to the town to do his business. And the
good clerk at once entered upon his duties, and, as much as they dared,
employed the members with which they were provided, and made great cheer
over the subtle manner in which the husband had been deceived. For a
long period did they continue thus to enjoy themselves; and if at any
time the good husband was forced to go abroad, he took care to leave
his clerk behind; rather would he borrow a servant from one of his
neighbours than not leave the clerk to mind house. And if the lady
had leave to go on any pilgrimage, she would rather go without her
tire-woman than without the kind and obliging clerk.
</p>
<p>
In short, as you may suppose, never could clerk boast of a more lucky
adventure, and which&mdash;so far as I know&mdash;never came to the knowledge of
the husband, who would have been overcome with grief had he learned of
the trick.

<h2>
    STORY THE FOURTEENTH &mdash; THE POPE-MAKER, OR THE HOLY MAN. <a href="#note-14" name="noteref-14">14</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur de Crequy
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a hermit who deceived the daughter of a poor woman, making her
believe that her daughter should have a son by him who should become
Pope; and how, when she brought forth it was a girl, and thus was the
trickery of the hermit discovered, and for that cause he had to flee
from that countery.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The borders of Burgundy furnish many adventures worthy to be written and
remembered, and have provided the present story, not to speak of many
others which could be related. I will here only speak of an adventure
which happened formerly in a big village on the river Ousche.
</p>
<p>
There was, and is still, a mountain near, on which a hermit&mdash;of
God knows what sort&mdash;made his residence, and who under the cloak of
hypocrisy did many strange things, which did not come to the knowledge
of the common people until the time when God would no longer suffer his
most damnable abuses to continue.
</p>
<p>
This holy hermit was during all his life as lewd and mischievous as an
old ape, but surpassed all ordinary mortals in cunning. And this is what
he did.
</p>
<p>
He sought amongst all the women and pretty girls the one most worthy to
be loved and desired, and resolved that it was the daughter of a poor,
simple woman,&mdash;a widow who was very devout and charitable&mdash;and made up
his mind that, if he could have his way, she should become his prey.
</p>
<p>
One night, about midnight, when the weather was very rough and stormy,
he descended from the mountain and came to the village, and passing by
bye-roads and footpaths, came to where the mother and daughter lived,
without being seen or heard. He knew the house, which was not large, and
to which he had often been for devotional purposes.
</p>
<p>
He bored a hole in a part of the wall not exposed, and near the spot
where stood the bed of the simple widow woman, and passing a long,
hollow stick, with which he was provided, and without awaking the widow,
placed it near her ear, and said in a low voiced three times,
</p>
<p>
"Hear my voice, woman of God. I am an angel of the Creator, and have
been sent to you to announce that for your many good deeds which you
have performed there shall issue from your seed, that is your daughter,
one who shall unite, reform, and restore his bride the Church. And it
shall be in this manner. Thou shalt go to the mountain, to the holy
hermit, and take thy daughter, and relate to him at length that which
God now commands you by me. He shall know thy daughter, and from them
shall spring a son, the elect of God, and destined to fill the Holy Seat
of Rome, who shall do such good deeds that he may fitly be compared to
St. Peter and St. Paul. Hearken to my voice! Obey God!"
</p>
<p>
The foolish widow, much astonished and surprised, and half ravished with
delight, really believed that God had sent this messenger. She vowed to
herself that she would not disobey, and it was long ere she slept again,
and then not very soundly, so greatly did she desire and await the day.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the good hermit returned to his hermitage in the mountain. The
much-desired day at last dawned, and the sun pierced into the chamber of
the said widow, and both mother and daughter rose in great haste.
</p>
<p>
When they were up and dressed, and their little household set in order,
the mother asked her daughter if she had heard anything in the night.
</p>
<p>
The daughter replied, "No, mother; nothing."
</p>
<p>
"It was not to you," said the mother, "that the message was first
delivered, albeit it concerns you greatly."
</p>
<p>
Then she related at length the angel's message which God had sent her,
and asked her what she should reply thereto?
</p>
<p>
The girl, who was like her mother, simple and devout, replied; "Praise
be to God. Whatever pleases you, mother, shall be done."
</p>
<p>
"That is well spoken," replied the mother. "Let us go to the mountain to
the holy man, as the angel bade us."
</p>
<p>
The hermit was on the watch to see whether the foolish woman would bring
her innocent daughter, and beheld them coming. He left his door half
open, and knelt down in prayer in his chamber, in order that he might be
found at his devotions.
</p>
<p>
It happened as he wished, for the good woman and her daughter, when they
saw the door open, entered at once; and when they beheld the hermit in
holy contemplation, as though he had been a god, they did homage to him.
</p>
<p>
The hermit, with his eyes bent down to the earth, said in a humble
voice; "God save you both."
</p>
<p>
Then the poor, old woman, anxious that he should know the cause of her
coming, took him on one side, and told him from beginning to end the
story&mdash;which he knew better than she did. And as she related the tale
with great veneration and respect, the hermit folded his hands and
turned up his eyes to heaven, and the good old woman wept, more for joy
than for grief; and the poor girl also wept when she saw this good and
holy hermit pray with such deep devotion she did not know why.
</p>
<p>
When the story was finished, the old woman awaited the reply, which he
did not hasten to give. But after a certain time he spoke, and said,
</p>
<p>
"Praise be to God! But, my dear friend, are you really sure that the
message you say you heard, may not have been some fancy or illusion
created by your own heart? The matter is a serious one."
</p>
<p>
"I certainly heard the voice, father, which brought me this joyful
message, as plainly as I now hear you, and I do not think I was asleep."
</p>
<p>
"Well," said he, "I should be unwilling to act against the wishes of my
Creator; but it seems best to me that you and I should again sleep upon
this matter, and if the angel should appear to you again, come back and
tell me, and God will give us good counsel. We should not believe too
readily, good mother. The devil, who is always envious of the good, has
many tricks, and can change himself into an angel of light. Believe me,
mother, it is no light thing you ask of me, and it is no marvel if I
seem to hesitate. Have I not sworn before God, a vow of chastity? And
here you bring me word that I am to break my oath! Return to your house
and pray to God, and to-morrow we shall see what will happen. God be
with you."
</p>
<p>
After much discussion, they left the hermit and returned home
thoughtfully.
</p>
<p>
To cut the story short, our hermit, at the accustomed time set forth,
carrying a hollow stick instead of a staff, and putting it near the
pillow of the foolish woman, delivered much the same message as on the
previous night; and that being done, returned at once to his hermitage.
</p>
<p>
The good woman, filled with joy, rose early and related all the story
to her daughter, showing how the vision of the previous night had been
confirmed. "There is no time to be lost! We must go to the holy man!"
</p>
<p>
They went, and he saw them coming, and took his breviary and acted the
hypocrite as before, but God knows he was not thinking of his devotions.
And just as he had finished, and was about to recommence, there were the
two women in front of his hut saluting him, and you may fancy that the
old lady hurried through her narration; whereupon the good man made the
sign of the cross, and feigning great surprise, said,
</p>
<p>
"Oh God! my Creator! What is this? Do with me as you will&mdash;though, if
it were not for thy great grace, I am not worthy to perform such a great
work!"
</p>
<p>
"But see, father!" said the much-abused and deceived woman: "the message
is true, since the angel has again appeared unto me."
</p>
<p>
"In truth, my dear friend, this matter is of great importance and very
difficult and strange, so that I yet can give but a doubtful reply.
Not that I would tempt God by demanding another vision, but there is a
saying 'The third time is sure'. Therefore I beg and desire of you to
let pass this night also, and await the pleasure of God, and if of His
great mercy it please Him to show us also this night as on the previous
nights, we will do as He bids us to His praise."
</p>
<p>
It was not with a good grace that the foolish old woman was induced to
put off this act of obedience to God, but she knew the hermit was wiser
than she was.
</p>
<p>
When she was in bed, and thinking over all these marvellous visions,
this perverse hypocrite came down from his mountain, placed his hollow
stick to her ear, as before, and commanded her, once for all, to
obey the message and take her daughter to the hermit for the purpose
mentioned.
</p>
<p>
She did not forget, as soon as it was day, to do her duty, and when
she and her daughter had given thanks to God, they set out for the
hermitage, where the hermit came forth to meet them, and saluted and
blessed them in the name of God.
</p>
<p>
The good woman, more joyous than ever, informed him of the last vision.
The hermit took her by the hand and led her into the chapel, and
the girl followed them. There they made most devout prayers to the
all-powerful God who had vouchsafed to show them this mystery.
</p>
<p>
Then the hermit delivered a short sermon, touching dreams, visions,
apparitions, and revelations, which often come to certain people, and
alluded to the cause for which they were there assembled, and God knows
that he preached well and righteously.
</p>
<p>
"Since God willed and commanded that he should create a successor to the
Pope, and had deigned to reveal His will not once or twice, but three
times, he must needs believe and conclude that great results must follow
from this deed. It is my opinion," he concluded, "that we should no
longer defer the execution of His orders, seeing that we have already
delayed so long, through refusing to believe in this holy vision."
</p>
<p>
"That is well said, father. What would it please you to do?" replied the
old woman.
</p>
<p>
"You will leave your fair daughter here," said the hermit, "and she and
I will pray together, and moreover do whatever God shall teach us."
</p>
<p>
The good widow was much pleased, and her daughter was content to obey.
When the hermit found himself alone with the damsel, he made her strip
entirely as though he would baptise her, and you may fancy that the
hermit did not long remain dressed. But why make a long story? He lay
with her so long, and so often repeated it both in his cell and at her
home, that at last she could not leave the house for shame, for her
belly began to swell,&mdash;at which you need not be told she was overjoyed.
</p>
<p>
But if the daughter rejoiced to find herself pregnant, the mother
rejoiced a hundred times more, and the hypocritical hermit also
pretended to rejoice at the news, though inwardly he was bitterly vexed.
</p>
<p>
The poor credulous mother, really believing that her daughter would
bring forth a son who should in due time be Pope of Rome, could not
help relating the story to one of her intimate friends, who was as
much astonished as though she had found horns growing on her head, but,
nevertheless, suspected no trickery.
</p>
<p>
Ere long the neighbour had told the other male and female neighbours,
how the daughter of such an one was pregnant by the holy hermit of a son
who was to be Pope of Rome.
</p>
<p>
"And what I tell you," she said, "the mother of the girl told me, and
God revealed it to her."
</p>
<p>
The news soon spread through all the neighbouring towns. Soon afterwards
the girl was brought to bed, and duly delivered of a female child, at
which she and her foolish mother were both astonished and angry, and
the neighbours also, who expected the holy hermit to have been there to
receive the child.
</p>
<p>
The report spread quite as quickly as the previous one, and the hermit
was one of the first to hear of it, and quickly fled into another
country&mdash;I know not where&mdash;to deceive another woman or girl, or perhaps
into the desert of Egypt to perform penance, with a contrite heart, for
his sin. However that may be, the poor girl was dishonoured; which was a
great pity, for she was fair, good, and amiable.

<h2>
    STORY THE FIFTEENTH &mdash; THE CLEVER NUN.
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur De La Roche
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a nun whom a monk wished to deceive, and how he offered to shoo her
his weapon that she might feel it, but brought with him a companion whom
he put forward in his place, and of the answer she gave him.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In the fair country of Brabant, near to a monastery of white monks (*),
is situated a nunnery of devout and charitable nuns, but their name and
order need not be mentioned.
</p>
<pre>
     (*) Either Carthusians, who wear white robes and hoods, or
     Dominicans who wear white robes and black hoods.
</pre>
<p>
The two convents being close together, there was always a barn for
the threshers, as the saying is, for, thank God, the nuns were so
kind-hearted that few who sought amorous intercourse with them were
refused, provided only they were worthy to receive their favours.
</p>
<p>
But, to come to the story, there was amongst these white monks, a young
and handsome monk who fell in love with one of the nuns, and after some
preliminaries, had the courage to ask her for the love of God to grant
him her favours.
</p>
<p>
The nun, who knew how he was furnished, though she was by nature
courteous, gave him a harsh and sharp reply. He was not to be rebuffed,
however, but continued to implore her love with most humble requests,
until the pretty nun was forced either to lose her reputation for
courtesy, or give the monk what she had granted to many others as soon
as she was asked.
</p>
<p>
She said to him; "Truly you weary me with requests for that which
honestly I ought not to give you. But I have heard what sort of weapon
you carry, and if it be so you have not much to thank Nature for."
</p>
<p>
"I do not know who told you," replied the monk, "but I am sure that you
will be satisfied with me, and I will prove to you that I am as good a
man as any other."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yes. I believe you are a man," said she "but your machine is so
small that if you were to put it in a certain place, I should hardly
know that it was there."
</p>
<p>
"It is quite the reverse," said the monk, "and, if I were in that place,
I would do so well that you would confess that those who gave me that
reputation were liars."
</p>
<p>
After these fair speeches, the kind nun, that she might know what he
could do, and perhaps not forgetting her own share in the pleasure, told
him to come to the window of her cell at midnight; for which favour he
thanked her gratefully.
</p>
<p>
"But at any rate," said she, "you shall not enter until I really know
what sort of lance you carry, and whether you can be of use to me or
not."
</p>
<p>
"As you please," replied the monk, and with that he quitted his
mistress, and went straight to Brother Conrad, one of his companions,
who was furnished, God knows how well, and for that reason was much
esteemed in the nunnery.
</p>
<p>
To him the young monk related how he had begged a favour of such an one,
and how she had refused, doubting whether his foot would fit her shoe,
but in the end had consented that he should come to her, but would
first feel and know with what sort of lance he would charge against her
shield.
</p>
<p>
"I have not," said he, "a fine thick lance, such as I know she would
desire to meet. Therefore I beg of you with all my heart, to come with
me this night at the hour when I am to meet her, and you will do me the
greatest service that ever one man did to another. I know very well that
she will want to touch and handle the lance, and this is what you must
do. You will be behind me; but do not speak. Then take my place, and put
your great machine in her hand. She will open the door then, I expect,
and you will go away and I will enter in,&mdash;and leave the rest to me."
</p>
<p>
Brother Conrad greatly doubted whether it would happen as his friend
wished, but he agreed to do as he was asked. At the appointed hour they
set forth to visit the nun. When they came to the window, the young
monk, who was more eager than a stallion, knocked once with his stick,
and the nun did not wait for him to knock a second time, but opened the
window, and said in a low voice;
</p>
<p>
"Who is there?"
</p>
<p>
"It is I," he replied; "Open your door, lest anyone should hear us."
</p>
<p>
"By my faith," quoth she, "you shall not be entered on the roll of my
lovers, until you have passed a review, and I know what equipments you
have. Come hither, and show me what it is like."
</p>
<p>
"Willingly," said he.
</p>
<p>
Then Brother Conrad took his place, and slipped into the nun's hand his
fine, powerful weapon, which was thick, long, and round. But as soon as
she felt it she recognized it, and said;
</p>
<p>
"No! No! I know that well enough. That is the lance of Brother Conrad.
There is not a nun here who does not know it! You thought I should be
deceived, but I know too much for you! Go and try your luck elsewhere!"
</p>
<p>
And with that she closed the window, being very angry and ill-pleased,
not with Brother Conrad, but with the other monk; and they after this
adventure, returned to their convent, pondering over all that had
happened.

<h2>
    STORY THE SIXTEENTH &mdash; ON THE BLIND SIDE. <a href="#note-16" name="noteref-16">16</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur Le Duc.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a knight of Picardy who went to Prussia, and, meanwhile his lady
took a lover, and was in bed with him when her husband returned; and how
by a cunning trick she got her lover out of the room without the knight
being aware of it.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In the County of Artois there lived formerly a noble knight, rich and
powerful, and married to a beautiful dame of high family. These two
lived together for long, and passed their days in peace and happiness.
And because the most powerful Duke of Burgundy, Count of Artois, and
their lord, was then at peace with all the great princes of Christendom,
the knight, who was most devout, reflected that he ought to offer to God
the body which had been given him, and which was fair and strong, and as
well-formed as that of any man in that country, save that he had lost
an eye in a battle. To perform the vow he had made,&mdash;after he had taken
leave of his wife and relatives, he betook himself to the noble knights
of Prussia,&mdash;the true defenders of the holy-Christian church (*); and in
Prussia he fought valiantly and had many adventures&mdash;which I pass over
here&mdash;and at the end was safe and sound, though he had shown great
prowess, and the reports of his valour had been widely spread about by
those who had seen them and returned to their own country, or by the
letters they had written to many who had heard of his deeds with much
pleasure.
</p>
<pre>
     (*) Doubtless there was a confusion In the writer's mind
     between Prussia and Hungary, and he alludes to the Crusade
     against the Turks which ended disastrously for the Crusaders
     in 1396, and in which Jean sans Peur and many Burgundian
     knights took part.
</pre>
<p>
Now you must know that his lady, who stayed at home, had bestowed
her affection on a squire who sought her love, and was glad to have a
substitute for her liege lord, who was away fighting the Saracens.
</p>
<p>
Whilst my lord was fasting and doing penance, my lady made good cheer
with the squire; often did my lord dine and sup on bread and water,
whilst my lady was enjoying all the good things which God had given her
in plenty; my lord,&mdash;if he could do no better,&mdash;lay upon straw, and my
lady rested in a fine bed with the squire.
</p>
<p>
To cut matters short, whilst my lord was fighting the Saracens, my lady
was indulging in another sort of combat with the squire, and did so well
thereat, that if my lord had never returned he would not have been much
missed or regretted.
</p>
<p>
The knight finding that&mdash;thanks be to God&mdash;the Saracens were no longer
on the offensive; and that it was a long time since he had seen his
home, and his good wife, who much desired and regretted him, as she had
many times told him in her letters, prepared to return, and started
with the few retainers he had. And he fared so well, owing to the great
desire he had to return to his home, and the arms of his wife, that in a
few days he was near there.
</p>
<p>
Being more anxious than any of his followers, he was always the first to
rise, and the foremost on the journey. In fact, he made such speed
that he often rode alone, a quarter of a league or more ahead of his
retainers.
</p>
<p>
One day, it chanced the knight had lodged about six leagues from his
home. He rose early in the morning and mounted his horse, intending to
arrive at his house before his wife, who knew nothing of his coming, was
awake.
</p>
<p>
He set out as he intended, and, when on the road, he said to his
followers, "Come at your leisure; there is no need for you to follow me.
I will ride on fast that I may surprise my wife in bed."
</p>
<p>
His retainers being weary, and their horses also, did not oppose his
wishes, but travelled along at their ease, though they had some fears
for the knight, who rode thus fast in the dark and alone.
</p>
<p>
He made such speed that soon he was in the courtyard of his castle,
where he found a serving-man, to whom he gave his horse; then, in his
boots and spurs, he went straight, and without meeting any one, for it
was yet early in the morning, towards the chamber where my lady slept,
and where the squire was doing that which the knight longed to do.
</p>
<p>
You may guess that the squire and the lady were both astonished when the
knight thundered on the door&mdash;which was locked&mdash;with his staff.
</p>
<p>
"Who is there?" asked the lady.
</p>
<p>
"It is I," replied the knight. "Open the door!"
</p>
<p>
The lady, who knew her husband's voice, did not feel comfortable;
nevertheless she caused the squire to dress himself which he did as
quickly as he could, wondering how he should escape from his dangerous
position. She meanwhile pretended to be asleep, and not recognise her
husband's voice, and when he knocked at the door a second time, she
asked again, "Who is there?" "It is your husband, wife! Open the door
quickly!"
</p>
<p>
"My husband?" said she. "Alas, he is far from here! May God soon bring
him back in safety."
</p>
<p>
"By my soul, wife, I am your husband! Did you not know my voice? I knew
yours as soon as I heard you speak."
</p>
<p>
"When he does come, I shall know of it long beforehand, that I may
receive him as I ought, and that I may call together his relations
and friends to wish him a hearty welcome. Go away! Go away! and let me
sleep!"
</p>
<p>
"By St. John I will take care you do not! Open the door! Do you not know
your own husband?" and with that he called her by her name.
</p>
<p>
She saw that her lover was by that time quite ready, and made him stand
behind the door. Then she said to the knight.
</p>
<p>
"Is it really you? For God's sake pardon me! And are you in good
health?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes; thank God," said the knight.
</p>
<p>
"God be praised!" said the lady. "I will come directly and let you in;
but I am not dressed, and must get a candle."
</p>
<p>
"Take your time!" said the knight.
</p>
<p>
"Truly," said the lady, "just as you knocked, my lord, I was much
disturbed by a dream I had about you."
</p>
<p>
"And what was that, my dear?"
</p>
<p>
"Faith, my lord! I dreamed that you came back, and talked with me, and
that you saw as well with one eye as with the other.
</p>
<p>
"Would to God it were so," said my lord.
</p>
<p>
"By our Lady," said his wife, "I believe it is as I say."
</p>
<p>
"By my word", replied the knight, "you are very foolish. How could it be
so?"
</p>
<p>
"I maintain," said she, "that it is so."
</p>
<p>
"There is nothing of the kind," said the knight. "You must be mad to
think so."
</p>
<p>
"Ah, my lord," she replied, "you will never make me believe it is not as
I say, and, to set my mind at rest, I ask of you to give me a proof."
</p>
<p>
Thereupon she opened the door, holding a lighted candle in her hand, and
he, not displeased at her words, permitted her to make trial, and thus
the poor man allowed her to cover up his eye with her one hand, whilst
with the other she held the candle before his blind eye. Then she said;
</p>
<p>
"My lord! on your oath, can you not see well?"
</p>
<p>
"I swear I cannot," said my lord.
</p>
<p>
Whilst this trick was being played, my lord's substitute stole out of
the chamber without being perceived by him.
</p>
<p>
"Wait a moment, my lord," said she. "<i>Now</i> cannot you see well? Tell me
the truth!"
</p>
<p>
"No, by God, my dear," replied the knight. "How should I see? You have
stopped up my right eye, and the other I lost more than ten years ago."
</p>
<p>
"Then," said she, "I see it was but an idle, foolish dream; but, be that
as it may, God be praised and thanked that you are here."
</p>
<p>
"Amen," said the knight, and with that he kissed and embraced her many
times, and they rejoiced greatly.
</p>
<p>
And my lord did not forget to tell her how he had left his retainers
behind, and what speed he had made that he might find her in bed.
</p>
<p>
"Truly," said my lady, "you are a good husband."
</p>
<p>
And with that there came women and other servants, who took off the
knight's armour, and undressed him. That being done, he got into bed
with the lady, and enjoyed what the squire had left&mdash;who, for his part,
meanwhile went his way, happy and joyful to have escaped.
</p>
<p>
Thus was the knight deceived, as you have heard; nor was he ever
informed of it that I am aware, though it was known to many people.

<h2>
    STORY THE SEVENTEENTH &mdash; THE LAWYER AND THE BOLTING-MILL.
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur Le Duc.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a President of Parliament, who fell in love with his chamber-maid,
and would have forced her whilst she was sifting flour, but by fair
speaking she dissuaded him, and made him shake the sieve whilst she
went unto her mistress, who came and found her husband thus, as you will
afterwards hear.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
There lived formerly at Paris a President of the Court of Accounts, who
was a learned clerk, a knight, and a man of ripe age, but right joyous
and pleasant to both men and women.
</p>
<p>
This worthy lord had married a woman who was both elderly and sickly,
and by her had divers children. And amongst the other damsels, waiting
women, and servant maids in his house, was a serving-wench whom nature
had made most fair, and who did the household work; made the beds,
baked the bread, and did other low offices. The gentleman, who made
love whenever he found a chance, did not conceal from the fair wench his
intentions towards her, and made attempts upon her virtue, promising her
many rich gifts, and explaining to her that it was her duty to let him
have his way, and trying first this way and then that to seduce her. But
he was grieved to find that he could not induce her to return his love.
The girl was wise and chaste, and not so foolish as to grant her master
any favour, but spoke him so fairly that he did not lose heart, though
he would have preferred a different kind of answer.
</p>
<p>
When he found that kindness was of no use, he tried harshness and rough
words, but the wench was not frightened, and told him that, "He might
do as he pleased, but whilst she had life she would never let him near
her."
</p>
<p>
The gentleman, seeing that her mind was fully made-up, spake no more
to her for some days, but spared not loving looks and signs; which much
annoyed her, and if she had not feared to make discord between husband
and wife, she would have told the latter how unfaithful her spouse was,
but, in the end, she resolved to conceal this as long as she could.
</p>
<p>
The infatuation of the old man increased every day, and begging and
praying no longer sufficed. He went to her and renewed his entreaties
and vows, which he confirmed by a hundred thousand oaths. But&mdash;to cut
matters short&mdash;it was all no good; he could not obtain a single word, or
the least shadow of hope, that he would ever attain his purpose.
</p>
<p>
Thereupon he left her, but he did not forget to say that if ever he
found a favourable opportunity she would have to comply with his wishes,
or it would be the worse for her.
</p>
<p>
The wench was not much frightened, thought no more of it, and went about
her duties as usual.
</p>
<p>
Some time afterwards, one Monday morning, the pretty servant, having
some pies to make, was sifting meal. Now you must know that the room
where she was thus engaged, was not far from her master's bedroom, and
he heard the noise of the sieve, and knew very well that it was made by
the servant-girl at her work.
</p>
<p>
He thought that perhaps she was not alone, but, if she should be, he
would never find a better chance.
</p>
<p>
He said to himself, "Though she has often refused me by word of mouth, I
shall succeed at last if I only keep to my purpose."
</p>
<p>
It was early dawn, and his wife was not awake, at which he was glad. He
stole quietly out of bed; put on his dressing-gown and his slippers, and
crept to the damsel's room so quietly that she never knew he was there
until she saw him.
</p>
<p>
The poor girl was much astonished, and trembled; suspecting that her
master had come to take that which she would never give him.
</p>
<p>
Seeing she was frightened, he said nothing but attacked her with such
violence that he would soon have taken the place by storm if she had not
sued for peace. She said to him;
</p>
<p>
"Alas, sir, I beg for mercy! My life and honour are in your hands;&mdash;have
pity on me!"
</p>
<p>
"I care nothing about honour," said her master, who was very hot and
excited. "You are in my hands and cannot escape me," and with that he
attacked her more violently than before.
</p>
<p>
The girl, finding resistance was useless, bethought herself of a
stratagem, and said,
</p>
<p>
"Sir, I prefer to surrender of free-will than by force. Leave me alone,
and I will do all that you may require."
</p>
<p>
"Very well," said her master, "but be sure that I will not let you go
free."
</p>
<p>
"There is but one thing I would beg of you, sir" replied the girl.
"I greatly fear that my mistress may hear you; and if, by chance, she
should come and find you here, I should be lost and ruined, for she
would either beat me or kill me."
</p>
<p>
"She is not likely to come," said he, "she is sleeping soundly."
</p>
<p>
"Alas, sir, I am in great fear of her and, as I would be assured, I beg
and request of you, for my peace of mind and our greater security in
what we are about to do, that you let me go and see whether she is
sleeping, or what she is doing."
</p>
<p>
"By our Lady! you would never return," said the gentleman.
</p>
<p>
"I swear that I will," she replied, "and that speedily."
</p>
<p>
"Very good then," said he. "Make haste!"
</p>
<p>
"Ah, sir," said she. "It would be well that you should take this sieve
and work as I was doing; so that if my lady should by chance awake, she
will hear the noise and know that I am at work."
</p>
<p>
"Give it to me, and I will work well;&mdash;but do not stay long."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, no, sir. Hold this sieve, and you will look like a woman."
</p>
<p>
"As to that, God knows I care not," said he, and with that laid hold of
the sieve and began to work it as best he could.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile the virtuous wench mounted to her lady's room and woke her,
and told her how her husband had attempted her virtue, and attacked her
whilst she was sifting meal, "And if it please you to come and see how I
escaped him," she said, "come down with me and behold him."
</p>
<p>
The lady rose at once, put on her dress, and was soon before the door
of the room where her lord was diligently sifting. And when she saw him
thus employed, and struggling with the sieve, she said to him;
</p>
<p>
"Ah, master, what is this? Where are now all your learning, your honour,
your knowledge and prudence?"
</p>
<p>
He saw that he had been deceived, and replied quickly.
</p>
<p>
"Wife, they are all collected at the end of my c&mdash;k.", and with that,
being much annoyed and angry, he threw down the sieve and went back to
his room.
</p>
<p>
His wife followed him, and began to lecture him again, but he paid
little heed. When he was ready, he ordered his mule, and went to the
palace, where he related his adventure to divers gentlemen, who laughed
loudly thereat. And, although he was at first angry with the wench,
he afterwards helped her, by his influence and rich gifts, to find a
husband.

<h2>
    STORY THE EIGHTEENTH &mdash; FROM BELLY TO BACK. <a href="#note-18" name="noteref-18">18</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur De La Roche.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a gentleman of Burgundy who paid a chambermaid ten crowns to sleep
with her, but before he left her room, had his ten crowns back, and
made her carry him on her shoulders through the host's chamber. And in
passing by the said chamber he let wind so loudly that all was known, as
you will hear in the story which follows.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A gentleman of Burgundy went on some business to Paris, and lodged at a
good inn, for it was his custom always to seek out the best lodgings. He
knew a thing or two, and he noticed that the chambermaid did not look a
sort of woman who was afraid of a man. So, without much ado, or making
two bites at a cherry, he asked if he could sleep with her?
</p>
<p>
But she set her back up at once. "How dare you make such a proposal
to me," she said. "I would have you to know that I am not one of those
girls who bring scandal upon the houses in which they live." And in
short, for all he could say she refused to have anything to do with him
"for any money."
</p>
<p>
The gentleman who knew well what all these protestations were worth,
said to her;
</p>
<p>
"My dear, if fitting time and place were given me, I would tell you
something you would be glad to learn; but as, perhaps, it might hurt
your reputation if you were seen conversing with me, talk to my valet,
and he will arrange matters on my behalf."
</p>
<p>
"I have nothing to say either to him or to you," she replied, and with
that she walked away, and the gentleman called his valet, who was a
clever rogue, and ordered him to follow her and win her over at any
cost.
</p>
<p>
The valet, who was well trained, promised that he would perform his
task, and, as soon as he found her, set to work to employ honied
phrases, and if she had not been of Paris, and not the least cunning of
the women of that city, his soft speeches and the promises he made on
behalf of his master, would soon have gained her heart.
</p>
<p>
But as it was, after much talk between them, she cut matters short by
saying;
</p>
<p>
"I know well what your master wants, but he shall not touch me unless I
have ten crowns."
</p>
<p>
The servant reported this to his master, who was not so generous, or
at least not in such a case, as to give ten crowns to enjoy a kitchen
wench.
</p>
<p>
"Be that as it may," replied the valet, "she will not budge from that;
and even then you must use precautions in going to her chamber, for you
must pass through that of the host. What do you intend to do?"
</p>
<p>
"By my oath!" said his master, "I regret sorely having to pay ten
crowns, but I am so smitten with the wench that I cannot give her up. To
the devil with avarice! she shall have the money."
</p>
<p>
"Shall I tell her then you will give her the money?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, in the devil's name! Yes!"
</p>
<p>
The valet found the girl, and told her she should have the money, and
perhaps something more.
</p>
<p>
"Very good," she replied.
</p>
<p>
To cut matters short, a time was arranged for the gentleman to come to
her, but, before she would show him the way to her room, she insisted on
the ten crowns being paid down.
</p>
<p>
The Burgundian was not over-pleased, and as he was on the way to her
chamber, it struck him that he was paying dearly for his amusement, and
he resolved that he would play her a trick.
</p>
<p>
He stole into her room so quietly that neither the host nor his wife
awaked. There he undressed, and said to himself that he would at least
have his money's worth. He did marvels, and got as good as he sent.
</p>
<p>
What with jesting and other matters, the hours passed quickly, and dawn
was near. He was then more willing to sleep than to do anything else,
but the fair chambermaid said to him;
</p>
<p>
"Sir, I have heard and seen so much of your nobleness, honour, and
courtesy that I have consented to allow you to take that which I hold
dearest in all the world. I now beg and request of you that you will
at once dress and hasten away, for it is now day, and if by chance my
master or mistress should come here, as is often their custom in the
morning, and should find you here, I should be dishonoured, nor would it
do you any good."
</p>
<p>
"I care not," quoth he, "what good or evil may happen, but here I will
remain, and sleep at my ease and leisure before I leave. I am entitled
to that for my money. Do you think you have so easily earned my ten
crowns? You took them quickly enough. By St. George! I have no fear; but
I will stay here and you shall bear me company, if you please."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, sir," she replied, "by my soul I cannot do this. You must leave. It
will be full day directly, and if you are found here what will become of
me? I would rather die than that should happen; and if you do not make
haste I much fear some one will come."
</p>
<p>
"Let them come," said the gentleman. "I care not, but, I tell you
plainly, that until you give me back my ten crowns, I will not leave
here, happen what may."
</p>
<p>
"Your ten crowns?" she answered. "Are you a man of that sort, and so
devoid of any courtesy or grace as to take back from me in that fashion,
that which you have given? By my faith that is not the way to prove
yourself a gentleman."
</p>
<p>
"Whatever I am," said he, "I will not leave here, or shall you either,
until you have given me back my ten crowns; you gained them too easily."
</p>
<p>
"May God help me," she replied, "though you speak thus I do not believe
you would be so ungrateful, after the pleasure I have given you, or so
discorteous, as not to aid me to preserve my honour, and therefore I beg
of you to grant my request, and leave here."
</p>
<p>
The gentleman said that he would do nothing of the sort, and in the
end the poor girl was forced&mdash;though God knows with what regret&mdash;to
hand-over the ten crowns in order to make him go. When the money had
returned to the hand that gave it, the girl was very angry, but the man
was in great glee.
</p>
<p>
"Now," said the girl, angrily, "that you have thus tricked and deceived
me, at least make haste. Let it suffice that you have made a fool of me,
and do not by delay bring dishonour upon me by being seen here."
</p>
<p>
"I have nothing to do with your honour," said he. "Keep it as much as
like, but you brought me here and you must take me back to the place
from whence I came, for I do not intend to have the double trouble of
coming and returning."
</p>
<p>
The chambermaid, seeing that she only made him more obstinate, and that
day was breaking fast, took the gentleman on her back, and though sick
at heart with fear and anger, began to carry him. And as she was picking
her way carefully and noiselessly, this courteous gentleman, who after
having ridden on her belly was now riding on her back, broke wind so
loudly that the host awoke, and called out in his fright;
</p>
<p>
"Who is there?"
</p>
<p>
"It is your chambermaid," said the gentleman, "who is taking me back to
the place from whence she brought me."
</p>
<p>
At these words the poor girl's heart and strength failed her. She could
no longer bear her unpleasant burden, and she fell on the floor and
rolled one way, whilst the squire went rolling the other.
</p>
<p>
The host, who knew what was the matter, spoke sharply to the girl, who
soon afterwards left his house; and the gentleman returned to Burgundy,
where he often gleefully related to his gallant companions the above
written adventure.

STORY THE NINETEENTH &mdash; THE CHILD OF THE SNOW. <a href="#note-19" name="noteref-19">19</a>
</center>
<p>
By Philippe Vignier.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of an English merchant whose wife had a child in his absence, and told
him that it was his; and how he cleverly got rid of the child&mdash;for his
wife having asserted that it was born of the snow, he declared it had
been melted by the sun.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Moved by a strong desire to see and know foreign countries, and to meet
with adventures, a worthy and rich merchant of London left his fair and
good wife, his children, relations, friends, estates, and the greater
part of his possessions, and quitted the kingdom, well furnished with
money and great abundance of merchandise, such as England can supply
to foreign countries, and with many other things which, for the sake of
brevity, I do not mention here.
</p>
<p>
On this first voyage, the good merchant wandered about for a space of
five years, during which time his good wife looked after his property,
disposed of much merchandise profitably, and managed so well that her
husband, when he returned at the end of five years, greatly praised her,
and loved her more than ever.
</p>
<p>
The merchant, not content with the many strange and wonderful things
he had seen, or with the large fortune he had made, four or five months
after his return, again set forth in quest of adventures in foreign
lands, both Christian and pagan, and stayed there so long that ten years
passed before his wife again saw him, but he often wrote to her, that
she might know that he was still alive.
</p>
<p>
She was young and lusty, and wanted not any of the goods that God could
give, except the presence of her husband. His long absence constrained
her to provide herself with a lover, by whom shortly she had a fine boy.
</p>
<p>
This son was nourished and brought up with the others, his
half-brothers, and, when the merchant returned, was about seven years
old.
</p>
<p>
Great were the rejoicings between husband and wife when he came back,
and whilst they were conversing pleasantly, the good woman, at the
demand of her husband, caused to be brought all their children, not
omitting the one who had been born during the absence of him whose name
she bore.
</p>
<p>
The worthy merchant seeing all these children, and remembering perfectly
how many there should be, found one over and above; at which he was much
astonished and surprised, and he inquired of his wife who was this fair
son, the youngest of their children?
</p>
<p>
"Who is he?" said she; "On my word, husband, he is our son! Who else
should he be?"
</p>
<p>
"I do not know," he replied, "but, as I have never seen him before, is
it strange that I should ask?"
</p>
<p>
"No, by St. John," said she; "but he is our son."
</p>
<p>
"How can that be?" said her husband. "You were not pregnant when I
left."
</p>
<p>
"Truly I was not, so far as I know," she replied, "but I can swear that
the child is yours, and that no other man but you has ever lain with
me."
</p>
<p>
"I never said so," he answered, "but, at any rate, it is ten years since
I left, and this child does not appear more than seven. How then can it
be mine? Did you carry him longer than you did the others?"
</p>
<p>
"By my oath, I know not!" she said; "but what I tell you is true.
Whether I carried it longer than the others I know not, and if you
did not make it before you left, I do not know how it could have come,
unless it was that, not long after your departure, I was one day in our
garden, when suddenly there came upon me a longing and desire to eat
a leaf of sorrel, which at that time was thickly covered with snow. I
chose a large and fine leaf, as I thought, and ate it, but it was only
a white and hard piece of snow. And no sooner had I eaten it than I
felt myself to be in the same condition as I was before each of my other
children was born. In fact, a certain time afterwards, I bore you this
fair son."
</p>
<p>
The merchant saw at once that he was being fooled, but he pretended to
believe the story his wife had told him, and replied;
</p>
<p>
"My dear, though what you tell me is hardly possible, and has never
happened to anyone else, let God be praised for what He has sent us. If
He has given us a child by a miracle, or by some secret method of which
we are ignorant, He has not forgotten to provide us with the wherewithal
to keep it."
</p>
<p>
When the good woman saw that her husband was willing to believe the tale
she told him, she was greatly pleased. The merchant, who was both wise
and prudent, stayed at home the next ten years, without making any other
voyages, and in all that time breathed not a word to his wife to make
her suspect he knew aught of her doings, so virtuous and patient was he.
</p>
<p>
But he was not yet tired of travelling, and wished to begin again. He
told his wife, who was very dissatisfied thereat.
</p>
<p>
"Be at ease," he said, "and, if God and St. George so will, I will
return shortly. And as our son, who was born during my last voyage, is
now grown up, and capable of seeing and learning, I will, if it seem
good to you, take him with me."
</p>
<p>
"On my word", said she "I hope you will, and you will do well."
</p>
<p>
"It shall be done," he said, and thereupon he started, and took with him
the young man, of whom he was not the father, and for whom he felt no
affection.
</p>
<p>
They had a good wind, and came to the port of Alexandria, where the good
merchant sold the greater part of his merchandise very well. But he was
not so foolish as to keep at his charge a child his wife had had by
some other man, and who, after his death, would inherit like the other
children, so he sold the youth as a slave, for good money paid down, and
as the lad was young and strong, nearly a hundred ducats was paid for
him.
</p>
<p>
When this was done, the merchant returned to London, safe and sound,
thank God. And it need not be told how pleased his wife was to see him
in good health, but when she saw her son was not there, she knew not
what to think.
</p>
<p>
She could not conceal her feelings, and asked her husband what had
become of their son?
</p>
<p>
"Ah, my dear," said he, "I will not conceal from you that a great
misfortune has befallen him."
</p>
<p>
"Alas, what?" she asked. "Is he drowned?"
</p>
<p>
"No; but the truth is that the wind and waves wafted us to a country
that was so hot that we nearly died from the great heat of the sun. And
one day when we had all left the ship, in order that we each might dig a
hole in which to shield ourselves from the heat,&mdash;our dear son, who, as
you know was made of snow, began to melt in the sun, and in our presence
was turned into water, and ere you could have said one of the seven
psalms, there was nothing left of him. Thus strangely did he come
into the world, and thus suddenly did he leave it. I both was, and
am, greatly vexed, and not one of all the marvels I have ever seen
astonished me so greatly."
</p>
<p>
"Well!" said she. "Since it has pleased God to give and to take away,
His name be praised."
</p>
<p>
As to whether she suspected anything or not, the history is silent and
makes no mention, but perhaps she learned that her husband was not to be
hood-winked.

<h2>
    STORY THE TWENTIETH &mdash; THE HUSBAND AS DOCTOR.
</h2>
<h3>
    By Philippe De Laon.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a young squire of Champagne who, when he married, had never mounted
a Christian creature,&mdash;much to his wife's regret. And of the method her
mother found to instruct him, and how the said squire suddenly wept at
a great feast that was made shortly after he had learned how to perform
the carnal act&mdash;as you will hear more plainly hereafter.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
It is well known that in the province of Champagne you are sure to meet
heavy and dull-witted persons&mdash;which has seemed strange to many persons,
seeing that the district is so near to the country of Mischief. (*)
Many stories could be told of the stupidity of the Champenois, but this
present story will suffice.
</p>
<pre>
     (*) <i>Mal-Eugen</i> in the original. The author probably means
     Picardy or Lorraine.
</pre>
<p>
In this province, there lived a young man, an orphan, who at the death
of his father and mother had become rich and powerful. He was stupid,
ignorant, and disagreeable, but hard-working and knew well how to
take care of himself and his affairs, and for this reason, many
persons,&mdash;even people of condition,&mdash;were willing to give him their
daughter in marriage.
</p>
<p>
One of these damsels, above all others, pleased the friends and
relations of our Champenois, for her beauty, goodness, riches, and so
forth. They told him that it was time he married.
</p>
<p>
"You are now," they said, "twenty-three years old, and there could not
be a better time. And if you will listen to us, we have searched out
for you a fair and good damsel who seems to us just suited to you. It is
such an one&mdash;you know her well;" and they told him her name.
</p>
<p>
The young man, who cared little whether he was married or not, as
long as he lost no money by it, replied that he would do whatever they
wished. "Since you think it will be to my advantage, manage the business
the best way you can, and I will follow your advice and instructions."
</p>
<p>
"You say well," replied these good people. "We will select your wife as
carefully as though it were for ourselves, or one of our children."
</p>
<p>
To cut matters short, a little time afterwards our Champenois was
married; but on the first night, when he was sleeping with his wife,
he, never having mounted on any Christian woman, soon turned his back
to her, and a few poor kisses was all she had of him, but nothing on her
back. You may guess his wife was not well pleased at this; nevertheless,
she concealed her discontent.
</p>
<p>
This unsatisfactory state of things lasted ten days, and would have
continued longer if the girl's mother had not put a stop to it.
</p>
<p>
It should be known to you that the young man was unskilled in the
mysteries of wedlock, for during the lifetime of his parents he had been
kept with a tight hand, and, above all things, had been forbidden to
play at the beast with two backs, lest he should take too much delight
therein, and waste all his patrimony. This was wise of his parents, for
he was not a young man likely to be loved for his good looks.
</p>
<p>
As he would do nothing to anger his father or mother, and was, moreover,
not of an amorous disposition, he had always preserved his chastity,
though his wife would willingly have deprived him of it, if she had
known how to do so honestly.
</p>
<p>
One day the mother of the bride came to her daughter, and asked her all
about her husband's state and condition, and the thousand other things
which women like to know. To all of these questions the bride replied
that her husband was a good man, and she hoped and believed that she
would be happy with him.
</p>
<p>
But the old woman knew by her own experience that there are more things
in married life than eating and drinking, so she said to her daughter;
</p>
<p>
"Come here, and tell me, on your word of honour, how does he acquit
himself at night?"
</p>
<p>
When the girl heard this question she was so vexed and ashamed that she
could not reply, and her eyes filled with tears. Her mother understood
what these tears meant, and said;
</p>
<p>
"Do not weep, my child! Speak out boldly! I am your mother, and you
ought not to conceal anything from me, or be afraid of telling me. Has
he done nothing to you yet?"
</p>
<p>
The poor girl, having partly recovered, and being re-assured by
her mother's words, ceased her tears, but yet could make no reply.
Thereupon, her mother asked again;
</p>
<p>
"Lay aside your grief and answer me honestly: has he done nothing to you
yet?"
</p>
<p>
In a low voice, mingled with tears, the girl replied, "On my word,
mother, he has never yet touched me, but, except for that, there is no
more kind or affectionate man."
</p>
<p>
"Tell me," said the mother; "do you know if he is properly furnished
with all his members? Speak out boldly, if you know."
</p>
<p>
"By St. John! he is all right in that respect," replied the bride. "I
have often, by chance, felt his luggage as I turned to and fro in our
bed when I could not sleep."
</p>
<p>
"That is enough," said the mother; "leave the rest to me. This is what
<i>you</i> must do. In the morning you must pretend to be very ill&mdash;even as
though your soul were departing from your body. Your husband will, I
fully expect, seek me out and bid me come to you, and I will play my
part so well that your business will be soon settled, for I shall take
your water to a certain doctor, who will give such advice as I order."
</p>
<p>
All was done as arranged, for on the morrow, as soon as it was dawn, the
girl, who was sleeping with her husband, began to complain and to sham
sickness as though a strong fever racked her body.
</p>
<p>
Her booby husband was much vexed and astonished, and knew not what to
say or do. He sent forthwith for his mother-in-law, who was not long in
coming. As soon as he saw her, "Alas! mother!" said he, "your daughter
is dying."
</p>
<p>
"My daughter?" said she. "What does she want?" and whilst she was
speaking she walked to the patient's chamber.
</p>
<p>
As soon as the mother saw her daughter, she asked what was the matter;
and the girl, being well instructed what she was to do, answered not at
first, but, after a little time, said, "Mother, I am dying."
</p>
<p>
"You shall not die, please God! Take courage! But how comes it that you
are taken ill so suddenly?"
</p>
<p>
"I do not know! I do not know!" replied the girl. "It drives me wild to
answer all these questions."
</p>
<p>
The old woman took the girl's hand, and felt her pulse; then she said to
her son-in-law;
</p>
<p>
"On my word she is very ill. She is full of fire, and we must find some
remedy. Have you any of her water?"
</p>
<p>
"That which she made last night is there," said one of the attendants.
</p>
<p>
"Give it me," said the mother.
</p>
<p>
She took the urine, and put it in a proper vessel, and told her
son-in-law that she was about to show it to such-and-such a doctor, that
he might know what he could do to her daughter to cure her.
</p>
<p>
"For God's sake spare nothing," said she. "I have yet some money left,
but I love my daughter better than money."
</p>
<p>
"Spare!" quoth he. "If money can help, you shall not want."
</p>
<p>
"No need to go so fast," said she. "Whilst she is resting, I will go
home; but I will come back if I am wanted."
</p>
<p>
Now you must know that the old woman had on the previous day, when she
left her daughter, instructed the doctor, who was well aware of what he
ought to say. So the young man carried his wife's water to the doctor,
and when he had saluted him, related how sick and suffering his wife
was.
</p>
<p>
"And I have brought you some of her water that you may judge how ill she
is, and more easily cure her."
</p>
<p>
The doctor took the vessel of urine, and turned it about and examined
it, then said;
</p>
<p>
"Your wife is afflicted with a sore malady, and is in danger of dying
unless help be forthcoming; her water shows it."
</p>
<p>
"Ah, master, for God's sake tell me what to do, and I will pay you well
if you can restore her to health, and prevent her from dying."
</p>
<p>
"She need not die," said the doctor; "but unless you make haste, all the
money in the world will not save her life."
</p>
<p>
"Tell me, for God's sake," said the other, "what to do, and I will do
it."
</p>
<p>
"She must," said the doctor, "have connection with a man, or she will
die."
</p>
<p>
"Connection with a man?" said the other, "What is that?"
</p>
<p>
"That is to say," continued the doctor, "that you must mount on the top
of her, and speedily ram her three or four times, or more if you can;
for, if not, the great heat which is consuming her will not be put out."
</p>
<p>
"Ah! will that be good for her?"
</p>
<p>
"There is no chance of her living," said the doctor, "if you do not do
it, and quickly too."
</p>
<p>
"By St. John," said the other, "I will try what I can do."
</p>
<p>
With that he went home and found his wife, who was groaning and
lamenting loudly.
</p>
<p>
"How are you, my dear?" said he.
</p>
<p>
"I am dying, my dear," she replied.
</p>
<p>
"You shall not die, please God," said he. "I have seen the doctor, who
has told me what medicine will cure you," and as he spoke, he undressed
himself, and lay down by his wife, and began to execute the orders he
had received from the doctor.
</p>
<p>
"What are you doing?" said she. "Do you want to kill me?"
</p>
<p>
"No! I am going to cure you," he replied. "The doctor said so;" and
Nature instructing him, and the patient helping, he performed on her two
or three times.
</p>
<p>
When he was resting from his labours, much astonished at what had
happened, he asked his wife how she was?
</p>
<p>
"I am a little better than I was before;" she replied.
</p>
<p>
"God be praised," said he. "I hope you will get well and that the doctor
told me truly:" and with that he began again.
</p>
<p>
To cut matters short, he performed so well that his wife was cured in
a few days, at which he was very joyful, and so was her mother when she
knew it.
</p>
<p>
The young man after this became a better fellow than he was before,
and his wife being now restored to health, he one day invited all his
relations and friends to dinner, and also the father and mother of his
wife, and he served grand cheer after his own fashion. They drank to
him, and he drank to them, and he was marvellous good company.
</p>
<p>
But hear what happened to him: in the midst of the dinner he began to
weep, which much astonished all his friends who were at table with
him, and they demanded what was the matter, but he could not reply for
weeping scalding tears. At last he spoke, and said;
</p>
<p>
"I have good cause to weep."
</p>
<p>
"By my oath you have not," replied his mother-in-law. "What ails you?
You are rich and powerful, and well housed, and have good friends; and
you must not forget that you have a fair and good wife whom God brought
back to health when she was on the edge of the grave. In my opinion you
ought to be light-hearted and joyful."
</p>
<p>
"Alas!" said he, "woe is me! My father and mother, who both loved me,
and who amassed and left me so much wealth, are both dead, and by my
fault, for they died of a fever, and if I had well towzled them both
when they were ill, as I did to my wife, they would still be on their
feet."
</p>
<p>
There was no one at table who, on hearing this, would not have liked to
laugh, nevertheless they restrained themselves as best they could. The
tables were removed, and each went his way, and the young man continued
to live with his wife, and&mdash;in order that she might continue in good
health&mdash;he failed not to tail her pretty often.

[ This story is taken from an old <i>fabliau</i> entitled <i>Les
Deux Changeurs</i>, and has been copied by Malespini, Straparolla, and
other Italian writers. Brantôme, in <i>Les Dames Galantes</i>, records that,
"Louis, Duc d'Orléans was a great seducer of Court ladies, and always
the greatest. A beautiful and noble lady was sleeping with him when
her husband came into the chamber to wish the Duke good-day. The Duke
covered the lady's head with the sheet, and uncovered the rest of her
body, and allowed the husband to look and touch as much as he liked, but
forbade him, as he valued his life, to uncover her head&mdash;And the best of
it was, that the next night, the husband being in bed with his wife told
her that the Duke had shown him the most beautiful naked woman that ever
he saw, but as to her face he could not report, being forbidden to
see it. I leave you to imagine what his wife thought!" The lady
was,&mdash;scandal averred&mdash;Mariette d'Enghien, the mother of the brave and
handsome Comte de Dunois, known in French history as "the bastard of
Orléans." In the M. S. discovered by Mr. Thomas Wright in the Hunterian
Library at Glasgow, this story is ascribed to "Monseigneur le Duc," as
is also the following one.]

Monseigneur de la Roche, the author of the story, was Chamberlain to the
Duke of Burgundy, at a salary of 36 <i>sols</i> per month. He was one of the
wisest councillors of Philippe le Bel and Charles le Téméraire, and
after the death of the latter was created Grand Seneschal of Burgundy.
He died about 1498. He was one of the most prolific of all the
contributors to the <i>Cent Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>, and related Nos 3, 8,
10, 12, 15, 18, 36, 37, 41, 44, 45, 47, 48, and 52.]

[ Jean de Lanoy (Launoy, in Vérard's 1st ed.) created a
knight of the Golden Fleece in 1451; an officer of the household of
the D. of Burgundy. Louis XI, on his accession, created him Governor
of Lille, and Bailli of Amiens, and sent him on a secret mission to the
King of England. Charles le Téméraire, indignant with Lanoy for having
gone over to his enemy, confiscated all his possessions in Brabant.
After the death of Charles, Lanoy went back to Burgundy, and took an
important share in the political events of the time. In some editions
stories Nos 82, and 92 are ascribed to him; in others, the one is by
Jehan Marten, and the other by "the Editor."]
