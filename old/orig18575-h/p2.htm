<h2>
    STORY THE TWENTY-FIRST &mdash; THE ABBESS CURED <a href="#note-21" name="noteref-21">21</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Philippe De Laon.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of an abbess who was ill for want of&mdash;you know what&mdash;but would not have
it done, fearing to be reproached by her nuns, but they all agreed to do
the same and most willingly did so.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In Normandy there is a fair nunnery, the Abbess of which was young,
fair, and well-made. It chanced that she fell ill. The good sisters who
were charitable and devout, hastened to visit her, and tried to comfort
her, and do all that lay in their power. And when they found she was
getting no better, they commanded one of the sisters to go to Rouen, and
take her water to a renowned doctor of that place.
</p>
<p>
So the next day one of the nuns started on this errand, and when she
arrived there she showed the water to the physician, and described at
great length the illness of the Lady Abbess, how she slept, ate, drank,
etc.
</p>
<p>
The learned doctor understood the case, both from his examination of
the water, and the information given by the nun, and then he gave his
prescription.
</p>
<p>
Now I know that it is the custom in many cases to give a prescription in
writing, nevertheless this time he gave it by word of mouth, and said to
the nun;
</p>
<p>
"Fair sister, for the abbess to recover her health there is but one
remedy, and that is that she must have company with a man; otherwise in
a short time she will grew so bad that death will be the only remedy."
</p>
<p>
Our nun was much astonished to hear such sad news, and said,
</p>
<p>
"Alas! Master John! is there no other method by which our abbess can
recover her health?"
</p>
<p>
"Certainly not," he replied; "there is no other, and moreover, you must
make haste to do as I have bid you, for if the disease is not stopped
and takes its course, there is no man living who could cure it."
</p>
<p>
The good nun, though much disconcerted, made haste to announce the news
to the Abbess, and by the aid of her stout cob, and the great desire she
had to be at home, made such speed that the abbess was astonished to see
her returned.
</p>
<p>
"What says the doctor, my dear?" cried the abbess. "Is there any fear of
death?"
</p>
<p>
"You will be soon in good health if God so wills, madam," said the
messenger. "Be of good cheer, and take heart."
</p>
<p>
"What! has not the doctor ordered me any medicine?" said the Abbess.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," was the reply, and then the nun related how the doctor had looked
at her water, and asked her age, and how she ate and slept, etc. "And
then in conclusion he ordered that you must have, somehow or other,
carnal connection with some man, or otherwise you will shortly be dead,
for there is no other remedy for your complaint."
</p>
<p>
"Connection with a man!" cried the lady. "I would rather die a thousand
times if it were possible." And then she went on, "Since it is thus, and
my illness is incurable and deadly unless I take such a remedy, let
God be praised! I will die willingly. Call together quickly all the
convent!"
</p>
<p>
The bell was rung, and all the nuns flocked round the Abbess, and, when
they were all in the chamber, the Abbess, who still had the use of her
tongue, however ill she was, began a long speech concerning the state of
the church, and in what condition she had found it and how she left it,
and then went on to speak of her illness, which was mortal and incurable
as she well knew and felt, and as such and such a physician had also
declared.
</p>
<p>
"And so, my dear sisters, I recommend to you our church, and that you
pray for my poor soul."
</p>
<p>
At these words, tears in great abundance welled from all eyes, and the
heart's fountain of the convent was moved. This weeping lasted long, and
none of the company spoke.
</p>
<p>
After some time, the Prioress, who was wise and good, spoke for all the
convent, and said;
</p>
<p>
"Madam, your illness&mdash;what it is, God, from whom nothing is hidden,
alone knows&mdash;vexes us greatly, and there is not one of us who would not
do all in her power to aid your recovery. We therefore pray you to spare
nothing, not even the goods of the Church, for it would be better for us
to lose the greater part of our temporal goods than be deprived of the
spiritual profit which your presence gives us."
</p>
<p>
"My good sister," said the Abbess, "I have not deserved your kind offer,
but I thank you as much as I can, and again advise and beg of you to
take care of the Church&mdash;as I have already said&mdash;for it is a matter
which concerns me closely, God knows; and pray also for my poor soul,
which hath great need of your prayers."
</p>
<p>
"Alas, madam," said the Prioress, "is it not possible that by great
care, or the diligent attention of some physician, that you might be
restored to health?"
</p>
<p>
"No, no, my good sister," replied the Abbess. "You must number me among
the dead&mdash;for I am hardly alive now, though I can still talk to you."
</p>
<p>
Then stepped forth the nun who had carried the water to Rouen, and said;
</p>
<p>
"Madam, there is a remedy if you would but try it." "I do not choose
to," replied the Abbess. "Here is sister Joan, who has returned from
Rouen, and has shown my water, and related my symptoms, to such and such
a physician, who has declared that I shall die unless I suffer some man
to approach me and have connection with me. By this means he hopes, and
his books informed him, that I should escape death; but if I did not do
as he bade me, there was no help for me. But as for me, I thank God that
He has deigned to call me, though I have sinned much. I yield myself to
His will, and my body is prepared for death, let it come when it may."
</p>
<p>
"What, madam!" said the infirmary nun, "would you murder yourself? It
is in your power to save yourself, and you have but to put forth your
hand and ask for aid, and you will find it ready! That is not right; and
I even venture to tell you that you are imperilling your soul if you die
in that condition."
</p>
<p>
"My dear sister," said the Abbess, "how many times have I told you that
it is better for a person to die than commit a deadly sin. You know that
I cannot avoid death except by committing a deadly sin. Also I feel sure
that even by prolonging my life by this means, I should be dishonoured
for ever, and a reproach to all. Folks would say of me, 'There is the
lady who &mdash;&mdash;'.
</p>
<p>
"All of you,&mdash;however you may advise me&mdash;would cease to reverence and
love me, for I should seem&mdash;and with good cause&mdash;unworthy to preside
over and govern you."
</p>
<p>
"You must neither say nor think that," said the Treasurer. "There is
nothing that we should not attempt to avoid death. Does not our good
father, St. Augustine, say that it is not permissible to anyone to take
his own life, nor to cut off one of his limbs? And are you not acting in
direct opposition to his teaching, if you allow yourself to die when you
could easily prevent it?"
</p>
<p>
"She says well!" cried all the sisters in chorus. "Madam, for God's sake
obey the physician, and be not so obstinate in your own opinion as to
lose both your body and soul, and leave desolate, and deprived of your
care, the convent where you are so much loved."
</p>
<p>
"My dear sisters," replied the Abbess, "I much prefer to bow my head to
death than to live dishonoured. And would you not all say&mdash;'There is the
woman who did so and so'."
</p>
<p>
"Do not worry yourself with what people would say: you would never be
reproached by good and respectable people."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, I should be," replied the Abbess.
</p>
<p>
The nuns were greatly moved, and retired and held a meeting, and passed
a resolution, which the Prioress was charged to deliver to the Abbess,
which she did in the following words.
</p>
<p>
"Madam, the nuns are greatly grieved,&mdash;for never was any convent more
troubled than this is, and you are the cause. We believe that you are
ill-advised in allowing yourself to die when we are sure you could
avoid it. And, in order that you should comprehend our loyal and
single-hearted love for you, we have decided and concluded in a general
assembly, to save you and ourselves, and if you have connection secretly
with some respectable man, we will do the same, in order that you may
not think or imagine that in time to come you can be reproached by any
of us. Is it not so, my sisters?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," they all shouted most willingly.
</p>
<p>
The Abbess heard the speech, and was much moved by the testimony of the
love the sisters bore her, and consented, though with much regret, that
the doctor's advice should be carried out. Monks, priests, and clerks
were sent for, and they found plenty of work to do, and they worked
so well that the Abbess was soon cured, at which the nuns were right
joyous.

<h2>
    STORY THE TWENTY-SECOND &mdash; THE CHILD WITH TWO FATHERS. <a href="#note-22" name="noteref-22">22</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Caron.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a gentleman who seduced a young girl, and then went away and joined
the army. And before his return she made the acquaintance of another,
and pretended her child was by him. When the gentleman returned from the
war he claimed the child, but she begged him to leave it with her second
lover, promising that the next she had she would give to him, as is
hereafter recorded.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Formerly there was a gentleman living at Bruges who was so often and so
long in the company of a certain pretty girl that at last he made her
belly swell.
</p>
<p>
And about the same time that he was aware of this, the Duke called
together his men-at-arms, and our gentleman was forced to abandon his
lady-love and go with others to serve the said lord, which he willingly
did. But, before leaving, he provided sponsors and a nurse against the
time his child should come into the world, and lodged the mother with
good people to whose care he recommended her, and left money for her.
And when he had done all this as quickly as he could, he took leave of
his lady, and promised that, if God pleased, he would return quickly.
</p>
<p>
You may fancy if she wept when she found that he whom she loved better
than any one in the world, was going away. She could not at first speak,
so much did her tears oppress her heart, but at last she grew calmer
when she saw that there was nothing else to be done.
</p>
<p>
About a month after the departure of her lover, desire burned in her
heart, and she remembered the pleasures she had formerly enjoyed, and of
which the unfortunate absence of her friend now deprived her. The God of
Love, who is never idle, whispered to her of the virtues and riches of a
certain merchant, a neighbour, who many times, both before and since the
departure of her lover, had solicited her love, so that she decided
that if he ever returned to the charge he should not be sent away
discouraged, and that even if she met him in the street she would behave
herself in such a way as would let him see that she liked him.
</p>
<p>
Now it happened that the day after she arrived at this determination,
Cupid sent round the merchant early in the morning to present her with
dogs and birds and other gifts, which those who seek after women are
always ready to present.
</p>
<p>
He was not rebuffed, for if he was willing to attack she was not the
less ready to surrender, and prepared to give him even more than he
dared to ask; for she found in him such chivalry, prowess, and virtue
that she quite forgot her old lover, who at that time suspected nothing.
</p>
<p>
The good merchant was much pleased with his new lady, and they so loved
each other, and their wills, desires, and thoughts so agreed, that it
was as though they had but a single heart between them. They could
not be content until they were living together, so one night the wench
packed up all her belongings and went to the merchant's house, thus
abandoning her old lover, her landlord and his wife, and a number of
other good people to whose care she had been recommended.
</p>
<p>
She was not a fool, and as soon as she found herself well lodged,
she told the merchant she was pregnant, at which he was very joyful,
believing that he was the cause; and in about seven months the wench
brought forth a fine boy, and the adoptive father was very fond both of
the child and its mother.
</p>
<p>
A certain time afterwards the gentleman returned from the war, and came
to Bruges, and as soon as he decently could, took his way to the house
where he had left his mistress, and asked news of her from those whom he
had charged to lodge her and clothe her, and aid her in her confinement.
</p>
<p>
"What!" they said. "Do you not know? Have you not had the letters which
were written to you?"
</p>
<p>
"No, by my oath," said he. "What has happened?'
</p>
<p>
"Holy Mary!" they replied, "you have good reason to ask. You had not
been gone more than a month when she packed up her combs and mirrors
and betook herself to the house of a certain merchant, who is greatly
attached to her. And, in fact, she has there been brought to bed of a
fine boy. The merchant has had the child christened, and believes it to
be his own."
</p>
<p>
"By St. John! that is something new," said the gentleman, "but, since
she is that sort of a woman, she may go to the devil. The merchant may
have her and keep her, but as for the child I am sure it is mine, and I
want it."
</p>
<p>
Thereupon he went and knocked loudly at the door of the merchant's
house. By chance, the lady was at home and opened the door, and when
she recognised the lover she had deserted, they were both astonished.
Nevertheless, he asked her how she came in that place, and she replied
that Fortune had brought her there.
</p>
<p>
"Fortune?" said he; "Well then, fortune may keep you; but I want my
child. Your new master may have the cow, but I will have the calf; so
give it to me at once, for I will have it whatever may happen."
</p>
<p>
"Alas!" said the wench, "what will my man say? I shall be disgraced, for
he certainly believes the child is his."
</p>
<p>
"I don't care what he thinks," replied the other, "but he shall not have
what is mine."
</p>
<p>
"Ah, my friend, I beg and request of you to leave the merchant this
child; you will do him a great service and me also. And by God! you will
not be tempted to have the child when once you have seen him, for he is
an ugly, awkward boy, all scrofulous and mis-shapen."
</p>
<p>
"Whatever he is," replied the other, "he is mine, and I will have him."
</p>
<p>
"Don't talk so loud, for God's sake!" said the wench, "and be calm, I
beg! And if you will only leave me this child, I promise you that I will
give you the next I have."
</p>
<p>
Angry as the gentleman was, he could not help smiling at hearing these
words, so he said no more and went away, and never again demanded the
child, which was brought up by the merchant.

<h2>
    STORY THE TWENTY-THIRD &mdash; THE LAWYER'S WIFE WHO PASSED THE LINE. <a href="#note-23" name="noteref-23">23</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur De Commesuram.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a clerk of whom his mistress was enamoured, and what he promised to
do and did to her if she crossed a line which the said clerk had made.
Seeing which, her little son told his father when he returned that he
must not cross the line; or said he, "the clerk will serve you as he did
mother."</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Formerly there lived in the town of Mons, in Hainault, a lawyer of a
ripe old age, who had, amongst his other clerks, a good-looking and
amiable youth, with whom the lawyer's wife fell deeply in love, for it
appeared to her that he was much better fitted to do her business than
her husband was.
</p>
<p>
She decided that she would behave in such a way that, unless he were
more stupid than an ass, he would know what she wanted of him; and, to
carry out her design, this lusty wench, who was young, fresh, and buxom,
often brought her sewing to where the clerk was, and talked to him of a
hundred thousand matters, most of them about love.
</p>
<p>
And during all this talk she did not forget to practise little tricks:
sometimes she would knock his elbow when he was writing; another time
she threw gravel and spoiled his work, so that he was forced to write it
all over again. Another time also she recommenced these tricks, and took
away his paper and parchment, so that he could not work,&mdash;at which he
was not best pleased, fearing that his master would be angry.
</p>
<p>
For a long time his mistress practised these tricks, but he being young,
and his eyes not opened, he did not at first see what she intended;
nevertheless at last he concluded he was in her good books.
</p>
<p>
Not long after he arrived at this conclusion, it chanced that the lawyer
being out of the house, his wife came to the clerk to teaze him as was
her custom, and worried him more than usual, nudging him, talking to
him, preventing him from working, and hiding his paper, ink &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
Our clerk more knowing than formerly, and seeing what all this meant,
sprang to his feet, attacked his mistress and drove her back, and begged
of her to allow him to write&mdash;but she who asked for nothing better than
a tussle, was not inclined to discontinue.
</p>
<p>
"Do you know, madam," said he, "that I must finish this writing which I
have begun? I therefore ask of you to let me alone or, morbleu, I will
pay you out."
</p>
<p>
"What would you do, my good lad?" said she. "Make ugly faces?"
</p>
<p>
"No, by God!*
</p>
<p>
"What then?"
</p>
<p>
"What?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, tell me what!"
</p>
<p>
"Why," said he, "since you have upset my inkstand, and crumpled my
writing, I will well crumple your parchment, and that I may not be
prevented from writing by want of ink, I will dip into your inkstand."
</p>
<p>
"By my soul," quoth she, "you are not the man to do it. Do you think I
am afraid of you?"
</p>
<p>
"It does not matter what sort of man I am," said the clerk, "but if you
worry me any more, I am man enough to make you pay for it. Look here!
I will draw a line on the floor, and by God, if you overstep it, be it
ever so little, I wish I may die if I do not make you pay dearly for
it."
</p>
<p>
"By my word," said she, "I am not afraid of you, and I will pass the
line and see what you will do," and so saying the merry hussy made a
little jump which took her well over the line.
</p>
<p>
The clerk grappled with her, and threw her down on a bench, and punished
her well, for if she had rumpled him outside and openly, he rumpled her
inside and secretly.
</p>
<p>
Now you must know that there was present at the time a young child,
about two years old, the son of the lawyer. It need not be said
either, that after this first passage of arms between the clerk and his
mistress, there were many more secret encounters between them, with less
talk and more action than on the first occasion.
</p>
<p>
You must know too that, a few days after this adventure, the little
child was in the office where the clerk was writing, when there came in
the lawyer, the master of the house, who walked across the room to
his clerk, to see what he wrote, or for some other matter, and as he
approached the line which the clerk had drawn for his wife, and which
still remained on the floor, his little son cried,
</p>
<p>
"Father, take care you do not cross the line, or the clerk will lay you
down and tumble you as he did mother a few days ago."
</p>
<p>
The lawyer heard the remark, and saw the line, but knew not what to
think; but if he remembered that fools, drunkards, and children always
tell the truth, at all events he made no sign, and it has never come to
my knowledge that he ever did so, either through want of confirmation of
his suspicions, or because he feared to make a scandal.

<h2>
    STORY THE TWENTY-FOURTH &mdash; HALF-BOOTED. <a href="#note-24" name="noteref-24">24</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur De Fiennes.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a Count who would ravish by force a fair, young girl who was one of
his subjects, and how she escaped from him by means of his leggings,
and how he overlooked her conduct and helped her to a husband, as is
hereafter related.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I know that in many of the stories already related the names of the
persons concerned are not stated, but I desire to give, in my little
history, the name of Comte Valerien, who was in his time Count of St.
Pol, and was called "the handsome Count". Amongst his other lordships,
he was lord of a village in the district of Lille, called Vrelenchem,
about a league distant from Lille.
</p>
<p>
This gentle Count, though of a good and kind nature, was very amorous.
He learned by report from one of his retainers, who served him in these
matters, that at the said Vrelenchem there resided a very pretty girl
of good condition. He was not idle in these matters, and soon after he
heard the news, he was in that village, and with his own eyes confirmed
the report that his faithful servants had given him concerning the said
maiden.
</p>
<p>
"The next thing to be done," said the noble Count, "is that I must speak
to her alone, no matter what it may cost me."
</p>
<p>
One of his followers, who was a doctor by profession, said, "My lord,
for your honour and that of the maiden also, it seems to me better that
I should make known to her your will, and you can frame your conduct
according to the reply that I receive."
</p>
<p>
He did as he said, and went to the fair maiden and saluted her
courteously, and she, who was as wise as she was fair and good, politely
returned his salute.
</p>
<p>
To cut matters short, after a few ordinary phrases, the worthy messenger
preached much about the possessions and the honours of his master, and
told her that if she liked she would be the means of enriching all her
family.
</p>
<p>
The fair damsel knew what o'clock it was. (*) Her reply was like
herself&mdash;fair and good&mdash;for it was that she would obey, fear, and serve
the Count in anything that did not concern her honour, but that she held
as dear as her life.
</p>
<pre>
     (*) A literal translation.   La bonne fille entendit tantost
     quelle heure il estoit.
</pre>
<p>
The one who was astonished and vexed at this reply was our go-between,
who returned disappointed to his master, his embassy having failed. It
need not be said that the Count was not best pleased at hearing of this
proud and harsh reply made by the woman he loved better than anyone in
the world, and whose person he wished to enjoy. But he said, "Let us
leave her alone for the present. I shall devise some plan when she
thinks I have forgotten her."
</p>
<p>
He left there soon afterwards, and did not return until six weeks had
passed, and, when he did return it was very quietly, and he kept himself
private, and his presence unknown.
</p>
<p>
He learned from his spies one day that the fair maiden was cutting grass
at the edge of a wood, and aloof from all company; at which he was very
joyful, and, all booted as he was, set out for the place in company with
his spies. And when he came near to her whom he sought, he sent away his
company, and stole close to her before she was aware of his presence.
</p>
<p>
She was astonished and confused, and no wonder, to see the Count so
close to her, and she turned pale and could not speak, for she knew by
report that he was a bold and dangerous man to women.
</p>
<p>
"Ha, fair damsel," said the Count, "you are wondrous proud! One is
obliged to lay siege to you. Now defend yourself as best you can, for
there will be a battle between us, and, before I leave, you shall suffer
by my will and desire, all the pains that I have suffered and endured
for love of you."
</p>
<p>
"Alas, my lord!" said the young girl, who was frightened and surprised.
"I ask your mercy! If I have said or done anything that may displease
you, I ask your pardon; though I do not think I have said or done
anything for which you should owe me a grudge. I do not know what report
was made of me. Dishonourable proposals were made to me in your name,
but I did not believe them, for I deem you so virtuous that on no
account would you dishonour one of your poor, humble subjects like me,
but on the contrary protect her."
</p>
<p>
"Drop this talk!" said my lord, "and be sure that you shall not escape
me. I told you why I sent to you, and of the good I intended to do you,"
and without another word, he seized her in his arms, and threw her down
on a heap of grass which was there, and pressed her closely, and quickly
made all preparations to accomplish his desire.
</p>
<p>
The young girl, who saw that she was on the point of losing that which
she held most precious, bethought her of a trick, and said,
</p>
<p>
"Ah, my lord, I surrender! I will do whatever you like, and without
refusal or contradiction, but it would be better that you should do with
me whatever you will by my free consent, than by force and against my
will accomplish your intent."
</p>
<p>
"At any rate," said my lord, "you shall not escape me! What is it you
want?"
</p>
<p>
"I would beg of you," said she, "to do me the honour not to dirty me
with your leggings, which are greasy and dirty, and which you do not
require."
</p>
<p>
"What can I do with them?" asked my lord.
</p>
<p>
"I will take them off nicely for you," said she, "if you please; for
by my word, I have neither heart nor courage to welcome you if you wear
those mucky leggings."
</p>
<p>
"The leggings do not make much difference," said my lord, "nevertheless
if you wish it, they shall be taken off."
</p>
<p>
Then he let go of her, and seated himself on the grass, and stretched
out his legs, and the fair damsel took off his spurs, and then tugged
at one of his leggings, which were very tight. And when with much
difficulty she had got it half off, she ran away as fast as her legs
could carry her with her will assisting, and left the noble Count, and
never ceased running until she was in her father's house.
</p>

">
</center>

<p>
The worthy lord who was thus deceived was in as great a rage as he could
be. With much trouble he got on his feet, thinking that if he stepped
on his legging he could pull it off, but it was no good, it was too
tight, and there was nothing for him to do but return to his servants.
He did not go very far before he found his retainers waiting for him by
the side of a ditch; they did not know what to think when they saw him
in that disarray. He related his story, and they put his boots on for
him, and if you had heard him you would have thought that she who thus
deceived him was not long for this world, he so cursed and threatened
her.
</p>
<p>
But angry as he was for a time, his anger soon cooled, and was converted
into sincere respect. Indeed he afterwards provided for her, and married
her at his own cost and expense to a rich and good husband, on account
of her frankness and loyalty.

<h2>
    STORY THE TWENTY-FIFTH &mdash; FORCED WILLINGLY. <a href="#note-25" name="noteref-25">25</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Philippe De Saint-Yon.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a girl who complained of being forced by a young man, whereas
she herself had helped him to find that which he sought;&mdash;and of the
judgment which was given thereon.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The incident on which I found my story happened so recently that I need
not alter, nor add to, nor suppress, the facts. There recently came
to the provost at Quesnay, a fair wench, to complain of the force and
violence she had suffered owing to the uncontrollable lust of a young
man. The complaint being laid before the provost, the young man accused
of this crime was seized, and as the common people say, was already
looked upon as food for the gibbet, or the headsman's axe.
</p>
<p>
The wench, seeing and knowing that he of whom she had complained was
in prison, greatly pestered the provost that justice might be done
her, declaring that without her will and consent, she had by force been
violated and dishonoured.
</p>
<p>
The provost, who was a discreet and wise man, and very experienced in
judicial matters, assembled together all the notables and chief men, and
commanded the prisoner to be brought forth, and he having come before
the persons assembled to judge him, was asked whether he would confess,
by torture or otherwise, the horrible crime laid to his charge, and the
provost took him aside and adjured him to tell the truth.
</p>
<p>
"Here is such and such a woman," said he, "who complains bitterly that
you have forced her. Is it so? Have you forced her? Take care that you
tell the truth, for if you do not you will die, but if you do you will
be pardoned."
</p>
<p>
"On my oath, provost," replied the prisoner, "I will not conceal from
you that I have often sought her love. And, in fact, the day before
yesterday, after a long talk together, I laid her upon the bed, to do
you know what, and pulled up her dress, petticoat, and chemise. But
my weasel could not find her rabbit hole, and went now here now there,
until she kindly showed it the right road, and with her own hands pushed
it in. I am sure that it did not come out till it had found its prey,
but as to force, by my oath there was none."
</p>
<p>
"Is that true?" asked the provost.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, on my oath," answered the young man.
</p>
<p>
"Very good," said he, "we shall soon arrange matters."
</p>
<p>
After these words, the provost took his seat in the pontifical chair,
surrounded by all the notable persons; and the young man was seated on
a small bench in front of the judges, and all the people, and of her who
accused him.
</p>
<p>
'"Now, my dear," said the provost, "what have you to say about the
prisoner?"
</p>
<p>
"Provost!" said she, "I complain that he has forced me and violated me
against my will and in spite of me. Therefore I demand justice."
</p>
<p>
"What have you to say in reply?" asked the provost of the prisoner.
</p>
<p>
"Sir," he replied, "I have already told how it happened, and I do not
think she can contradict me."
</p>
<p>
"My dear!" said the provost to the girl, "think well of what you are
saying! You complain of being forced. It is a very serious charge! He
says that he did not use any force, but that you consented, and indeed
almost asked for what you got. And if he speaks truly, you yourself
directed his weasel, which was wandering about near your rabbit-hole,
and with your two hands&mdash;or at least with one&mdash;pushed the said weasel
into your burrow. Which thing he could never have done without your
help, and if you had resisted but ever so little he would never have
effected his purpose. If his weasel was allowed to rummage in your
burrow, that is not his fault, and he is not punishable."
</p>
<p>
"Ah, Provost," said the girl plaintively, "what do you mean by that? It
is quite true, and I will not deny it, that I conducted his weasel into
my burrow&mdash;but why did I do so? By my oath, Sir, its head was so stiff,
and its muzzle so hard, that I was sure that it would make a large cut,
or two or three, on my belly, if I did not make haste and put it where
it could do little harm&mdash;and that is what I did."
</p>
<p>
You may fancy what a burst of laughter there was at the end of
this trial, both from the judges and the public. The young man was
discharged,&mdash;to continue his rabbit-hunting if he saw fit.
</p>
<p>
The girl was angry that he was not hanged on a high forked tree for
having hung on her "low forks" (*). But this anger and resentment did
not last long, for as I heard afterwards on good authority, peace was
concluded between them, and the youth had the right to ferret in the
coney burrow whenever he felt inclined.
</p>
<pre>
     (*) A play upon words, which is not easily translatable, in
     allusion to the gallows.

    STORY THE TWENTY-SIXTH &mdash; THE DAMSEL KNIGHT. <a href="#note-26" name="noteref-26">26</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur De Foquessoles.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of the loves of a young gentleman and a damsel, who tested the loyalty
of the gentleman in a marvellous and courteous manner, and slept three
nights with him without his knowing that it was not a man,&mdash;as you will
more fully hear hereafter.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In the duchy of Brabant&mdash;not so long ago but that the memory of it is
fresh in the present day&mdash;happened a strange thing, which is worthy of
being related, and is not unfit to furnish a story. And in order that it
should be publicly known and reported, here is the tale.
</p>
<p>
In the household of a great baron of the said country there lived and
resided a young, gracious, and kind gentleman, named Gerard, who was
greatly in love with a damsel of the said household, named Katherine.
And when he found opportunity, he ventured to tell her of his piteous
case. Most people will be able to guess the answer he received, and
therefore, to shorten matters, I omit it here.
</p>
<p>
In due time Gerard and Katherine loved each other so warmly that there
was but one heart and one will between them. This loyal and perfect love
endured no little time&mdash;indeed two years passed away. Love, who blinds
the eyes of his disciples, had so blinded these two that they did not
know that this affection, which they thought secret, was perceived by
every one; there was not a man or a woman in the chateau who was not
aware of it&mdash;in fact the matter was so noised abroad that all the talk
of the household was of the loves of Gerard and Katherine.
</p>
<p>
These two poor, deluded fools were so much occupied with their own
affairs that they did not suspect their love affairs were discussed by
others. Envious persons, or those whom it did not concern, brought
this love affair to the knowledge of the master and mistress of the
two lovers, and it also came to the ears of the father and mother of
Katherine.
</p>
<p>
Katherine was informed by a damsel belonging to the household, who was
one of her friends and companions, that her love for Gerard had been
discovered and revealed both to her father and mother, and also to the
master and mistress of the house.
</p>
<p>
"Alas, what is to be done, my dear sister and friend?" asked Katherine.
"I am lost, now that so many persons know, or guess at, my condition.
Advise me, or I am ruined, and the most unfortunate woman in the world,"
and at these words her eyes filled with tears, which rolled down her
fair cheeks and even fell to the edge of her robe.
</p>
<p>
Her friend was very vexed to see her grief, and tried to console her.
</p>
<p>
"My sister," she said, "it is foolish to show such great grief; for,
thank God, no one can reproach you with anything that touches your
honour or that of your friends. If you have listened to the vows of a
gentleman, that is not a thing forbidden by the Court of Honour, it is
even the path, the true road, to arrive there. You have no cause for
grief, for there is not a soul living who can bring a charge against
you. But, at any rate, I should advise that, to stop chattering tongues
which are discussing your love affairs, your lover, Gerard, should,
without more ado, take leave of our lord and lady, alleging that he is
to set out on a long voyage, or take part in some war now going on, and,
under that excuse, repair to some house and wait there until God and
Cupid have arranged matters. He will keep you informed by messages how
he is, and you will do the same to him; and by that time the rumours
will have ceased, and you can communicate with one another by letter
until better times arrive. And do not imagine that your love will
cease&mdash;it will be as great, or greater, than ever, for during a long
time you will only hear from each other occasionally, and that is one of
the surest ways of preserving love."
</p>
<p>
The kind and good advice of this gentle dame was followed, for as soon
as Katherine found means to speak to her lover, Gerard, she told him
how the secret of their love had been discovered and had come to the
knowledge of her father and mother, and the master and mistress of the
house.
</p>
<p>
"And you may believe," she said, "that it did not reach that point
without much talk on the part of those of the household and many of the
neighbours. And since Fortune is not so friendly to us as to permit us
to live happily as we began, but menaces us with further troubles, it is
necessary to be fore-armed against them. Therefore, as the matter much
concerns me, and still more you, I will tell you my opinion."
</p>
<p>
With that she recounted at full length the good advice which had been
given by her friend and companion.
</p>
<p>
Gerard, who had expected a misfortune of this kind, replied;
</p>
<p>
"My loyal and dear mistress, I am your humble and obedient servant, and,
except God, I love no one so dearly as you. You may command me to
do anything that seems good to you, and whatever you order shall be
joyfully and willingly obeyed. But, believe me, there is nothing left
for me in the world when once I am removed from your much-wished-for
presence. Alas, if I must leave you, I fear that the first news you will
hear will be that of my sad and pitiful death, caused by your absence,
but, be that as it may, you are the only living person I will obey, and
I prefer rather to obey you and die, than live for ever and disobey you.
My body is yours. Cut it, hack it, do what you like with it!"
</p>
<p>
You may guess that Katherine was grieved and vexed at seeing her lover,
whom she adored more than anyone in the world, thus troubled. Had it not
been for the virtue with which God had largely endowed her, she would
have proposed to accompany him on his travels, but she hoped for happier
days, and refrained from making such a proposal. After a pause, she
replied;
</p>
<p>
"My friend you must go away, but do not forget her who has given you her
heart. And that you may have courage in the struggle which is imposed
on you, know that I promise you on my word that as long as I live I will
never marry any man but you of my own free-will, provided that you are
equally loyal and true to me, as I hope you will be. And in proof of
this, I give you this ring, which is of gold enamelled with black tears.
If by chance they would marry me to some one else, I will defend myself
so stoutly that you will be pleased with me, and I will prove to you
that I can keep my promise without flinching from it. And, lastly, I beg
of you that wherever you may stop, you will send me news about yourself,
and I will do the same."
</p>
<p>
"Ah, my dear mistress," said Gerard, "I see plainly that I must leave
you for a time. I pray to God that he will give you more joy and
happiness than I am likely to have. You have kindly given me, though I
am not worthy of it, a noble and honourable promise, for which I cannot
sufficiently thank you. Still less do I deserve it, but I venture in
return to make a similar promise, begging most humbly and with all my
heart, that my vow may have as great a weight as if it came from a much
nobler man than I. Adieu, dearest lady. My eyes demand their turn, and
prevent my tongue from speaking."
</p>
<p>
With these words he kissed her, and pressed her tightly to his bosom,
and then each went away to think over his or her griefs.
</p>
<p>
God knows that they wept with their eyes, their hearts, and their heads,
but ere they showed themselves, they concealed all traces of their
grief, and put on a semblance of cheerfulness.
</p>
<p>
To cut matters short, Gerard did so much in a few days that he obtained
leave of absence from his master&mdash;which was not very difficult, not that
he had committed any fault, but owing to his love affair with Katherine,
with which her friends were not best pleased, seeing that Gerard was
not of such a good family or so rich as she was, and could not expect to
marry her.
</p>
<p>
So Gerard left, and covered such a distance in one day that he came to
Barrois, where he found shelter in the castle of a great nobleman of
the country; and being safely housed he soon sent news of himself to the
lady, who was very joyful thereat, and by the same messenger wrote to
tell him of her condition, and the goodwill she bore him, and how she
would always be loyal to him.
</p>
<p>
Now you must know that as soon as Gerard had left Brabant, many
gentlemen, knights and squires, came to Katherine, desiring above all
things to make her acquaintance, which during the time that Gerard
had been there they had been unable to do, knowing that her heart was
already occupied.
</p>
<p>
Indeed many of them demanded her hand in marriage of her father, and
amongst them was one who seemed to him a very suitable match. So he
called together many of his friends, and summoned his fair daughter, and
told them that he was already growing old, and that one of the greatest
pleasures he could have in the world was to see his daughter well
married before he died. Moreover, he said to them;
</p>
<p>
"A certain gentleman has asked for my daughter's hand, and he seems to
me a suitable match. If your opinion agrees with mine, and my daughter
will obey me, his honourable request will not be rejected."
</p>
<p>
All his friends and relations approved of the proposed marriage, on
account of the virtues, riches, and other gifts of the said gentleman.
But when they asked the opinion of the fair Katherine, she sought to
excuse herself, and gave several reasons for refusing, or at least
postponing this marriage, but at last she saw that she would be in the
bad books of her father, her mother, her relatives, friends, and her
master and mistress, if she continued to keep her promise to her lover,
Gerard.
</p>
<p>
At last she thought of a means by which she could satisfy her parents
without breaking her word to her lover, and said,
</p>
<p>
"My dearest lord and father, I do not wish to disobey you in anything
you may command, but I have made a vow to God, my creator, which I must
keep. Now I have made a resolution and sworn in my heart to God that
I would never marry unless He would of His mercy show me that that
condition was necessary for the salvation of my poor soul. But as I do
not wish to be a trouble to you, I am content to accept this condition
of matrimony, or any other that you please, if you will first give me
leave to make a pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Nicolas at Varengeville
(*) which pilgrimage I vowed and promised to make before I changed my
present condition."
</p>
<pre>
     (*) A town of Lorraine, on the Meurthe, about six miles from
     Kancy. Pilgrims flocked thither from all parts to worship
     the relics of St. Nicolas.
</pre>
<p>
She said this in order that she might see her lover on the road, and
tell him how she was constrained against her will.
</p>
<p>
Her father was rather pleased to hear the wise and dutiful reply of
his daughter. He granted her request, and wished to at once order her
retinue, and spoke to his wife about it when his daughter was present.
</p>
<p>
"We will give her such and such gentlemen, who with Ysabeau, Marguerite
and Jehanneton, will be sufficient for her condition."
</p>
<p>
"Ah, my lord," said Katherine, "if it so please you we will order it
otherwise. You know that the road from here to St. Nicolas is not very
safe, and that when women are to be escorted great precautions must be
taken. I could not go thus without great expense; moreover, the road is
long, and if it happened that we lost either our goods or honour (which
may God forfend) it would be a great misfortune. Therefore it seems good
to me&mdash;subject to your good pleasure&mdash;that there should be made for me a
man's dress and that I should be escorted by my uncle, the bastard, each
mounted on a stout horse. We should go much quicker, more safely, and
with less expense, and I should have more confidence than with a large
retinue."
</p>
<p>
The good lord, having thought over the matter a little while, spoke
about it to his wife, and it seemed to them that the proposal showed
much common sense and dutiful feeling. So everything was prepared for
their departure.
</p>
<p>
They set out on their journey, the fair Katherine and her uncle, the
bastard, without any other companion. Katherine, who was dressed in
the German fashion very elegantly, was the master, and her uncle, the
bastard, was the serving man. They made such haste that their pilgrimage
was soon accomplished, as far as St. Nicolas was concerned, and, as they
were on their return journey-praising God for having preserved them, and
talking over various matters Katherine said to her uncle,
</p>
<p>
"Uncle, you know that I am sole heiress to my father, and that I could
bestow many benefits upon you, which I will most willingly do if you
will aid me in a small quest I am about to undertake&mdash;that is to go to
the castle of a certain lord of Barrois (whom she named) to see Gerard,
whom you know. And, in order that when we return we may have some news
to tell, we will demand hospitality, and if we obtain it we will stop
there for some days and see the country, and you need be under no fear
but that I shall take care of my honour, as a good girl should."
</p>
<p>
The uncle, who hoped to be rewarded some day, and knew she was virtuous,
vowed to himself that he would keep an eye upon her, and promised to
serve her and accompany her wherever she wished. He was much thanked no
doubt, and it was then decided that he should call his niece, Conrad.
</p>
<p>
They soon came, as they desired, to the wished-for place, and addressed
themselves to the lord's major-domo, who was an old knight, and who
received them most joyfully and most honourably.
</p>
<p>
Conrad asked him if the lord, his master, did not wish to have in his
service a young gentleman who was fond of adventures, and desirous of
seeing various countries?
</p>
<p>
The major-domo asked him whence he came, and he replied, from Brabant.
</p>
<p>
"Well then," said the major-domo, "you shall dine here, and after dinner
I will speak to my lord."
</p>
<p>
With that he had them conducted to a fair chamber, and ordered the table
to be laid, and a good fire to be lighted, and sent them soup and a
piece of mutton, and white wine while dinner was preparing.
</p>
<p>
Then he went to his master and told him of the arrival of a young
gentleman of Brabant, who wished to serve him, and the lord was content
to take the youth if he wished.
</p>
<p>
To cut matters short, as soon as he had served his master, he returned
to Conrad to dine with him, and brought with him, because he was of
Brabant, the aforesaid Gerard, and said to Conrad;
</p>
<p>
"Here is a young gentleman who belongs to your country."
</p>
<p>
"I am glad to meet him," said Conrad.
</p>
<p>
"And you are very welcome," replied Gerard.
</p>
<p>
But he did not recognise his lady-love, though she knew him very well.
</p>
<p>
Whilst they were making each other's acquaintance, the meat was brought
in, and each took his place on either hand of the major-domo.
</p>
<p>
The dinner seemed long to Conrad, who hoped afterwards to have some
conversation with her lover, and expected also that she would soon be
recognised either by her voice, or by the replies she made to questions
concerning Brabant; but it happened quite otherwise, for during all the
dinner, the worthy Gerard did not ask after either man or woman in all
Brabant; which Conrad could not at all understand.
</p>
<p>
Dinner passed, and after dinner my lord engaged Conrad in his service;
and the major-domo, who was a thoughtful, experienced man, gave
instructions that as Gerard and Conrad came from the same place, they
should share the same chamber.
</p>
<p>
After this Gerard and Conrad went off arm in arm to look at their
horses, but as far as Gerard was concerned, if he talked about
anything it was not Brabant. Poor Conrad&mdash;that is to say the fair
Katherine&mdash;began to suspect that she was like forgotten sins, and had
gone clean out of Gerard's mind; but she could not imagine why, at
least, he did not ask about the lord and lady with whom she lived. The
poor girl was, though she could not show it, in great distress of mind,
and did not know what to do; whether to still conceal her identity, and
test him by some cunning phrases, or to suddenly make herself known.
</p>
<p>
In the end she decided that she would still remain Conrad, and say
nothing about Katherine unless Gerard should alter his manner.
</p>
<p>
The evening passed as the dinner had done, and when they came to their
chamber, Gerard and Conrad spoke of many things, but not of the one
subject pleasing to the said Conrad. When he saw that the other only
replied in the words that were put into his mouth, she asked of what
family he was in Brabant, and why he left there, and where he was when
he was there, and he replied as it seemed good to him.
</p>
<p>
"And do you not know," she said, "such and such a lord, and such
another?"
</p>
<p>
"By St. John, yes!" he replied.
</p>
<p>
Finally, she named the lord at whose castle she had lived; and he
replied that he knew him well, but not saying that he had lived there,
or ever been there in his life.
</p>
<p>
"It is rumoured," she said, "there are some pretty girls there. Do you
know of any?"
</p>
<p>
"I know very little," he replied, "and care less. Leave me alone; for I
am dying to go to sleep!"
</p>
<p>
"What!" she said. "Can you sleep when pretty girls are being talked
about? That is a sign that you are not in love!"
</p>
<p>
He did not reply, but slept like a pig, and poor Katherine began to have
serious doubts about him, but she resolved to try him again.
</p>
<p>
When the morrow came, each dressed himself, talking and chattering
meanwhile of what each liked best&mdash;Gerard of dogs and hawks, and Conrad
of the pretty girls of that place and Brabant.
</p>
<p>
After dinner, Conrad managed to separate Gerard from the others, and
told him that the country of Barrois was very flat and ugly, but Brabant
was quite different, and let him know that he (Conrad) longed to return
thither.
</p>
<p>
"For what purpose?" asked Gerard. "What do you see in Brabant that is
not here? Have you not here fine forests for hunting, good rivers, and
plains as pleasant as could be wished for flying falcons, and plenty of
game of all sorts?"
</p>
<p>
"Still that is nothing!" said Conrad. "The women of Brabant are very
different, and they please me much more than any amount of hunting or
hawking!"
</p>
<p>
"By St. John! they are quite another affair," said Gerard. "You are
exceedingly amorous in your Brabant, I dare swear!"
</p>
<p>
"By my oath!" said Conrad, "it is not a thing that can be hidden, for
I myself am madly in love. In fact my heart is drawn so forcibly that I
fear I shall be forced to quit your Barrois, for it will not be possible
for me to live long without seeing my lady love."
</p>
<p>
"Then it was a madness," said Gerard, "to have left her, if you felt
yourself so inconstant."
</p>
<p>
"Inconstant, my friend! Where is the man who can guarantee that he will
be constant in love. No one is so wise or cautious that he knows for
certain how to conduct himself. Love often drives both sense and reason
out of his followers."
</p>
<p>
The conversation dropped as supper time came, and was not renewed till
they were in bed. Gerard would have desired nothing better than to go to
sleep, but Conrad renewed the discussion, and began a piteous, long, and
sad complaint about his ladylove (which, to shorten matters, I omit) and
at last he said,
</p>
<p>
"Alas, Gerard, and how can you desire to sleep whilst I am so wide
awake, and my soul is filled with cares, and regrets, and troubles. It
is strange that you are not a little touched yourself, for, believe
me, if it were a contagious disease you could not be so close to me and
escape unscathed. I beg of you, though you do not feel yourself, to have
some pity and compassion on me, for I shall die soon if I do not behold
my lady-love."
</p>
<p>
"I never saw such a love-sick fool!" cried Gerard. "Do you think that I
have never been in love? I know what it is, for I have passed through
it the same as you&mdash;certainly I have! But I was never so love-mad as to
lose my sleep or upset myself, as you are doing now. You are an idiot,
and your love is not worth a doit. Besides do you think your lady is the
same as you are? No, no!"
</p>
<p>
"I am sure she is," replied Conrad; "she is so true-hearted."
</p>
<p>
"Ah, you speak as you wish," said Gerard, "but I do not believe that
women are so true as to always remain faithful to their vows; and those
who believe in them are blockheads. Like you, I have loved, and still
love. For, to tell you the truth, I left Brabant on account of a love
affair, and when I left I was high in the graces of a very beautiful,
good, and noble damsel, whom I quitted with much regret; and for no
small time I was in great grief at not being able to see her&mdash;though I
did not cease to sleep, drink, or eat, as you do. When I found that
I was no longer able to see her, I cured myself by following Ovid's
advice, for I had not been here long before I made the acquaintance of a
pretty girl in the house, and so managed, that&mdash;thank God&mdash;she now likes
me very much, and I love her. So that now I have forgotten the one I
formerly loved, and only care for the one I now possess, who has turned
my thoughts from my old love!"
</p>
<p>
"What!" cried Conrad. "Is it possible that, if you really loved the
other, you can so soon forget her and desert her? I cannot understand
nor imagine how that can be!"
</p>
<p>
"It is so, nevertheless, whether you understand it or not." "That is not
keeping faith loyally," said Conrad. "As for me, I would rather die
a thousand times, if that were possible, than be so false to my lady.
However long God may let me live, I shall never have the will, or even
the lightest thought, of ever loving any but her."
</p>
<p>
"So much the greater fool you," said Gerard, "and if you persevere in
this folly, you will never be of any good, and will do nothing but dream
and muse; and you will dry up like the green herb that is cast into the
furnace, and kill yourself, and never have known any pleasure, and
even your mistress will laugh at you,&mdash;if you are lucky enough to be
remembered by her at all."
</p>
<p>
"Well!" said Conrad. "You are very experienced in love affairs. I would
beg of you to be my intermediary, here or elsewhere, and introduce me to
some damsel that I may be cured like you."
</p>
<p>
"I will tell you what I will do," said Gerard. "Tomorrow I will speak to
my mistress and tell her that we are comrades, and ask her to speak to
one of her lady friends, who will undertake your business, and I do not
doubt but that, if you like, you will have a good time, and that the
melancholy which now bears you down will disappear&mdash;if you care to get
rid of it."
</p>
<p>
"If it were not for breaking my vow to my mistress, I should desire
nothing better," said Conrad, "but at any rate I will try it."
</p>
<p>
With that Gerard turned over and went to sleep, but Katherine was so
stricken with grief at seeing and hearing the falsehood of him whom she
loved more than all the world, that she wished herself dead and more
than dead. Nevertheless, she put aside all feminine feeling, and assumed
manly vigour. She even had the strength of mind to talk for a long time
the next day with the girl who loved the man <i>she</i> had once adored; and
even compelled her heart and eyes to be witnesses of many interviews and
love passages that were most galling to her.
</p>
<p>
Whilst she was talking to Gerard's mistress, she saw the ring that she
had given her unfaithful lover, but she was not so foolish as to admire
it, but nevertheless found an opportunity to examine it closely on the
girl's finger, but appeared to pay no heed to it, and soon afterwards
left.
</p>
<p>
As soon as supper was over, she went to her uncle, and said to him;
</p>
<p>
"We have been long enough in Barrois! It is time to leave. Be ready
to-morrow morning at daybreak, and I will be also. And take care that
all our baggage is prepared. Come for me as early as you like."
</p>
<p>
"You have but to come down when you will," replied the uncle.
</p>
<p>
Now you must know that after supper, whilst Gerard was conversing with
his mistress, she who had been his lady-love went to her chamber and
began to write a letter, which narrated at full length the love affairs
of herself and Gerard, also "the promises which they made at parting,
how they had wished to marry her to another and how she had refused, and
the pilgrimage that she had undertaken to keep her word and come to him,
and the disloyalty and falsehood she had found in him, in word, act,
and deed. And that, for the causes mentioned, she held herself free
and disengaged from the promise she had formerly made. And that she was
going to return to her own country and never wished to see him or meet
him again, he being the falsest man who ever made vows to a woman. And
as regards the ring that she had given him, that he had forfeited it by
passing it into the hands of a third person. And if he could boast that
he had lain three nights by her side, there was no harm, and he might
say what he liked, and she was not afraid."
</p>
<p>
<i>Letter written by a hand you ought to know</i>, and underneath <i>Katherine
etc., otherwise known as Conrad</i>; and on the back, <i>To the false Gerard</i>
etc.
</p>
<p>
She scarcely slept all night, and as soon as she saw the dawn, she rose
gently and dressed herself without awaking Gerard. She took the letter,
which she had folded and sealed, and placed it in the sleeve of Gerard's
jerkin; then in a vow voice prayed to God for him, and wept gently on
account of the grief she endured on account of the falseness she had met
with.
</p>
<p>
Gerard still slept, and did not reply a word. Then she went to her
uncle, who gave her her horse which she mounted, and they left the
country, and soon came to Brabant, where they were joyfully received,
God knows.
</p>
<p>
You may imagine that all sorts of questions were asked about their
adventures and travels, and how they had managed, but whatever they
replied they took care to say nothing about their principal adventure.
</p>
<p>
But to return to Gerard. He awoke about 10 o'clock on the morning of the
day when Katherine left, and looked to see if his companion Conrad was
already risen. He did not know it was so late, and jumped out of bed
in haste to seek for his jerkin. When he put his arm in the sleeve,
out dropped the letter, at which he was much astonished, for he did not
remember putting it there.
</p>
<p>
At any rate, he picked it up, and saw that it was sealed, and had
written on the back, <i>To the false Gerard</i>. If he had been astonished
before, he was still more so now.
</p>
<p>
After a little while he opened it and saw the signature, <i>Katherine
known as Conrad</i> etc.
</p>
<p>
He did not know what to think, nevertheless he read the letter, and in
reading it the blood mounted to his cheeks, and his heart sank within
him, so that he was quite changed both in looks and complexion.
</p>
<p>
He finished reading the letter the best way he could, and learned that
his falseness had come to the knowledge of her who wished so well to
him, and that she knew him to be what he was, not by the report of
another person, but by her own eyes; and what touched him most to the
heart was that he had lain three nights with her without having thanked
her for the trouble she had taken to come so far to make trial of his
love.
</p>
<p>
He champed the bit, and was wild with rage, when he saw how he had been
mystified. After much thought, he resolved that the best thing to do was
to follow her, as he thought he might overtake her.
</p>
<p>
He took leave of his master and set out, and followed the trail of their
horses, but did not catch them up before they came to Brabant, where
he arrived opportunely on the day of the marriage of the woman who had
tested his affection.
</p>
<p>
He wished to kiss her and salute her, and make some poor excuse for his
fault, but he was not able to do so, for she turned her back on him,
and he could not, all the time that he was there, find an opportunity of
talking with her.
</p>
<p>
Once he advanced to lead her to the dance, but she flatly refused in the
face of all the company, many of whom took note of the incident. For,
not long after, another gentleman entered, and caused the minstrels to
strike up, and advanced towards her, and she came down and danced with
him.
</p>
<p>
Thus, as you have heard, did the false lover lose his mistress. If there
are others like him, let them take warning by this example, which is
perfectly true, and is well known, and happened not so very long ago.

<h2>
    STORY THE TWENTY-SEVENTH &mdash; THE HUSBAND IN THE CLOTHES-CHEST. <a href="#note-27" name="noteref-27">27</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur De Beauvoir.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a great lord of this kingdom and a married lady, who in order
that she might be with her lover caused her husband to be shut in a
clothes-chest by her waiting women, and kept him there all the night,
whilst she passed the time with her lover; and of the wagers made
between her and the said husband, as you will find afterwards recorded.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
It is not an unusual thing, especially in this country, for fair dames
and damsels to often and willingly keep company with young gentlemen,
and the pleasant joyful games they have together, and the kind requests
which are made, are not difficult to guess.
</p>
<p>
Not long ago, there was a most noble lord, who might be reckoned as one
of the princes, but whose name shall not issue from my pen, who was much
in the good graces of a damsel who was married, and of whom report spoke
so highly that the greatest personage in the kingdom might have deemed
himself lucky to be her lover.
</p>
<p>
She would have liked to prove to him how greatly she esteemed him,
but it was not easy; there were so many adversaries and enemies to be
outwitted. And what more especially annoyed her was her worthy husband,
who kept to the house and played the part of the cursed Dangier, (*) and
the lover could not find any honourable excuse to make him leave.
</p>
<pre>
     (*) Allegorical personage typifying jealousy, taken from <i>Le
     Romaunt de la Rose</i>.
</pre>
<p>
As you may imagine, the lover was greatly dissatisfied at having to wait
so long, for he desired the fair quarry, the object of his long chase,
more than he had ever desired anybody in all his life.
</p>
<p>
For this cause he continued to importune his mistress, till she said to
him.
</p>
<p>
"I am quite as displeased as you can be that I can give you no better
welcome; but, you know, as long as my husband is in the house he must be
considered."
</p>
<p>
"Alas!" said he, "cannot you find any method to abridge my hard and
cruel martyrdom?"
</p>
<p>
She&mdash;who as has been said above, was quite as desirous of being with her
lover as he was with her&mdash;replied;
</p>
<p>
"Come to-night, at such and such an hour, and knock at my chamber
door. I will let you in, and will find some method to be freed from my
husband, if Fortune does not upset our plans."
</p>
<p>
Her lover had never heard anything which pleased him better, and after
many gracious thanks,&mdash;which he was no bad hand at making&mdash;he left her,
and awaited the hour assigned.
</p>
<p>
Now you must know that a good hour or more before the appointed time,
our gentle damsel, with her women and her husband, had withdrawn to her
chamber after supper; nor was her imagination idle, but she studied
with all her mind how she could keep her promise to her lover. Now she
thought of one means, now of another, but nothing occurred to her by
which she could get rid of her cursed husband; and all the time the
wished-for hour was fast approaching.
</p>
<p>
Whilst she was thus buried in thought, Fortune was kind enough to do her
a good turn, and her husband a bad one.
</p>
<p>
He was looking round the chamber, and by chance he saw at the foot of
the bed his wife's clothes-chest. In order to make her speak, and arouse
her from her reverie, he asked what that chest was used for, and why
they did not take it to the wardrobe, or some other place where it would
be more suitable.
</p>
<p>
"There is no need, Monseigneur," said Madame; "no one comes here but us.
I left it here on purpose, because there are still some gowns in it, but
if you are not pleased, my dear, my women will soon take it away."
</p>
<p>
"Not pleased?" said he. "No, I am not; but I like it as much here as
anywhere else, since it pleases you; but it seems to me much too small
to hold your gowns well without crumpling them, seeing what great and
long trains are worn now."
</p>
<p>
"By my word, sir," said she, "it is big enough."
</p>
<p>
"It hardly seems so," replied he, "really; and I have looked at it
well."
</p>
<p>
"Well, sir," said she, "will you make a bet with me?"
</p>
<p>
"Certainly I will," he answered; "what shall it be?"
</p>
<p>
"I will bet, if you like, half a dozen of the best shirts against the
satin to make a plain petticoat, that we can put you inside the box just
as you are."
</p>
<p>
"On my soul," said he, "I will bet I cannot get in."
</p>
<p>
"And I will bet you can."
</p>
<p>
"Come on!" said the women. "We will soon see who is the winner."
</p>
<p>
"It will soon be proved," said Monsieur, and then he made them take
out of the chest all the gowns which were in it, and when it was empty,
Madam and her women put in Monsieur easily enough.
</p>
<p>
Then there was much chattering, and discussion, and laughter, and Madam
said;
</p>
<p>
"Well, sir; you have lost your wager! You own that, do you not?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," said he, "you are right."
</p>
<p>
As he said these words, the chest was locked, and the girls all
laughing, playing, and dancing, carried both chest and man together, and
put it in a big cupboard some distance away from the chamber.
</p>
<p>
He cried, and struggled, and made a great noise; but it was no good,
and he was left there all the night. He could sleep, or think, or do the
best he could, but Madam had given secret instructions that he was not
to be let out that day, because she had been too much bothered by him
already.
</p>
<p>
But to return to the tale we had begun. We will leave our man in his
chest, and talk about Madam, who was awaiting her lover, surrounded
by her waiting women, who were so good and discreet that they never
revealed any secrets. They knew well enough that the dearly beloved
adorer was to occupy that night the place of the man who was doing
penance in the clothes-chest.
</p>
<p>
They did not wait long before the lover, without making any noise or
scare, knocked at the chamber door, and they knew his knock, and quickly
let him in. He was joyfully received and kindly entertained by Madam and
her maids; and he was glad to find himself alone with his lady love, who
told him what good fortune God had given her, that is to say how she had
made a bet with her husband that he could get into the chest, how he had
got in, and how she and her women had carried him away to a cupboard.
</p>
<p>
"What?" said her lover. "I cannot believe that he is in the house. By my
word, I believed that you had found some excuse to send him out whilst I
took his place with you for a time."
</p>
<p>
"You need not go," she said. "He cannot get out of where he is. He may
cry as much as he will, but there is no one here likes him well enough
to let him out, and there he will stay; but if you would like to have
him set free, you have but to say so."
</p>
<p>
"By Our Lady," said he, "if he does not come out till I let him out, he
will wait a good long time."
</p>
<p>
"Well then, let us enjoy ourselves," said she, "and think no more about
him."
</p>
<p>
To cut matters short, they both undressed, and the two lovers lay down
in the fair bed, and did what they intended to do, and which is better
imagined than described.
</p>
<p>
When day dawned, her paramour took leave of her as secretly as he could,
and returned to his lodgings to sleep, I hope, and to breakfast, for he
had need of both.
</p>
<p>
Madam, who was as cunning as she was wise and good, rose at the usual
hour, and said to her women;
</p>
<p>
"It will soon be time to let out our prisoner. I will go and see what he
says, and whether he will pay his ransom."
</p>
<p>
"Put all the blame on us," they said. "We will appease him."
</p>
<p>
"All right, I will do so," she said.
</p>
<p>
With these words she made the sign of the Cross, and went nonchalantly,
as though not thinking what she was doing, into the cupboard where her
husband was still shut up in the chest. And when he heard her he began
to make a great noise and cry out, "Who is there? Why do you leave me
locked up here?"
</p>
<p>
His good wife, who heard the noise he was making replied timidly, as
though frightened, and playing the simpleton;
</p>
<p>
"Heavens! who is it that I hear crying?"
</p>
<p>
"It is I! It is I!" cried the husband.
</p>
<p>
"You?" she cried; "and where do you come from at this time?"
</p>
<p>
"Whence do I come?" said he. "You know very well, madam. There is no
need for me to tell you&mdash;but what you did to me I will some day do to
you,"&mdash;for he was so angry that he would willingly have showered abuse
upon his wife, but she cut him short, and said;
</p>
<p>
"Sir, for God's sake pardon me. On my oath I assure you that I did not
know you were here now, for, believe me, I am very much astonished that
you should be still here, for I ordered my women to let you out whilst I
was at prayers, and they told me they would do so; and, in fact, one of
them told me that you had been let out, and had gone into the town,
and would not return home, and so I went to bed soon afterwards without
waiting for you."
</p>
<p>
"Saint John!" said he; "you see how it is. But make haste and let me
out, for I am so exhausted that I can stand it no longer."
</p>
<p>
"That may well be," said she, "but you will not come out till you have
promised to pay me the wager you lost, and also pardon me, or otherwise
I will not let you out."
</p>
<p>
"Make haste, for God's sake! I will pay you&mdash;really."
</p>
<p>
"And you promise?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes&mdash;on my oath!"
</p>
<p>
This arrangement being concluded, Madam opened the chest, and Monsieur
came out, tired, cramped, and exhausted.
</p>
<p>
She took him by the arm, and kissed him, and embraced him as gently as
could be, praying to God that he would not be angry.
</p>
<p>
The poor blockhead said that he was not angry with her, because she knew
nothing about it, but that he would certainly punish her women.
</p>
<p>
"By my oath, sir," said she, "they are well revenged upon you&mdash;for I
expect you have done something to them."
</p>
<p>
"Not I certainly, that I know of&mdash;but at any rate the trick they have
played me will cost them dear."
</p>
<p>
He had hardly finished this speech, when all the women came into the
room, and laughed so loudly and so heartily that they could not say a
word for a long time; and Monsieur, who was going to do such wonders,
when he saw them laugh to such a degree, had not the heart to interfere
with them. Madame, to keep him company, did not fail to laugh also.
There was a marvellous amount of laughing, and he who had the least
cause to laugh, laughed one of the loudest.
</p>
<p>
After a certain time, this amusement ceased, and Monsieur said;
</p>
<p>
"Mesdames, I thank you much for the kindness you have done me."
</p>
<p>
"You are quite welcome, sir," said one of the women, "and still we are
not quits. You have given us so much trouble, and caused as so much
mischief, that we owed you a grudge, and if we have any regret it is
that you did not remain in the box longer. And, in fact, if it had not
been for Madame you would still be there;&mdash;so you may take it how you
will!"
</p>
<p>
"Is that so?" said he. "Well, well, you shall see how I will take it.
By my oath I am well treated, when, after all I have suffered, I am only
laughed, at, and what is still worse, must pay for the satin for the
petticoat. Really, I ought to have the shirts that were bet, as a
compensation for what I have suffered."
</p>
<p>
"By Heaven, he is right," said the women. "We are on your side as to
that, and you shall have them. Shall he not have them, Madame?"
</p>
<p>
"On what grounds?" said she. "He lost the wager."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yes, we know that well enough: he has no right to them,&mdash;indeed he
does not ask for them on that account, but he has well deserved them for
another reason."
</p>
<p>
"Never mind about that," said Madame. "I will willingly give the
material out of love for you, mesdames, who have so warmly pleaded for
him, if you will undertake to do the sewing."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, truly, Madame."
</p>
<p>
Like one who when he wakes in the morning has but to give himself a
shake and he is ready, Monsieur needed but a bunch of twigs to beat his
clothes and he was ready, and so he went to Mass; and Madame and her
women followed him, laughing loudly at him I can assure you.
</p>
<p>
And you may imagine that during the Mass there was more than one giggle
when they remembered that Monsieur, whilst he was in the chest (though
he did not know it himself) had been registered in the book which has no
name. (*) And unless by chance this book falls into his hands, he will
never,&mdash;please God&mdash;know of his misfortune, which on no account would I
have him know. So I beg of any reader who may know him, to take care not
to show it to him.

<h2>
    STORY THE TWENTY-EIGHTH &mdash; THE INCAPABLE LOVER. <a href="#note-28" name="noteref-28">28</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Messire Miohaut De Changy.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of the meeting assigned to a great Prince of this kingdom by a damsel
who was chamber-woman to the Queen; of the little feats of arms of the
said Prince and of the neat replies made by the said damsel to the Queen
concerning her greyhound which had been purposely shut out of the room
of the said Queen, as you shall shortly hear.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
If in the time of the most renowned and eloquent Boccaccio, the
adventure which forms the subject of my tale had come to his knowledge,
I do not doubt but that he would have added it to his stories of great
men who met with bad fortune. For I think that no nobleman ever had a
greater misfortune to bear than the good lord (whom may God pardon!)
whose adventure I will relate, and whether his ill fortune is worthy
to be in the aforesaid books of Boccaccio, I leave those who hear it to
judge.
</p>
<p>
The good lord of whom I speak was, in his time, one of the great
princes of this kingdom, apparelled and furnished with all that befits a
nobleman; and amongst his other qualities was this,&mdash;that never was man
more destined to be a favourite with the ladies.
</p>
<p>
Now it happened to him at the time when his fame in this respect most
flourished, and everybody was talking about him, that Cupid, who casts
his darts wherever he likes, caused him to be smitten by the charms of
a beautiful, young, gentle and gracious damsel, who also had made a
reputation second to no other of that day on account of her great and
unequalled beauty and her good manners and virtues, and who, moreover,
was such a favourite with the Queen of that country that she shared the
royal bed on the nights when the said Queen did not sleep with the king.
</p>
<p>
This love affair, I must tell you, had advanced to such a point that
each only desired time and place to say and do what would most
please both. They were many days considering how to find a convenient
opportunity, and at last, she&mdash;who was as anxious for the welfare of her
lover as she was for the safety of her own reputation&mdash;thought of a good
plan, of which she hastened to inform him, saying as follows;
</p>
<p>
"My dearest friend, you know that I sleep with the Queen, and that it
is not possible for me&mdash;unless I would spoil everything&mdash;to resign
that honour and position which the noblest lady of the land would think
herself proud and happy to obtain. So that, though I would like to
please you and do your pleasure, I would remain on good terms with her,
and not desert her who can and does give me all the advancement and
honour in the world. I do not suppose that you would have me act
otherwise."
</p>
<p>
"No, by my soul, dearest," replied the worthy lord; "but at any rate I
would beg you that in serving your mistress your devoted lover should
not be forgotten, and that you do for him all that lies in your power,
for he would rather gain your love and good-will than aught else in the
world."
</p>
<p>
"This is what I will do for you, Monseigneur," said she. "The Queen, as
you know, has a greyhound of which she is very fond, that sleeps in
her chamber. I will find means to shut it out of the room without her
knowledge, and when everybody has retired, I will jump out of bed, run
to the reception room, and unbolt the door. Then, when you think that
the Queen is in bed, you must come quietly, and enter the reception room
and close the door after you. There you will find the greyhound, who
knows you well enough, and will let you approach it; pull its ears and
make it cry out, and when the Queen hears that, I expect that she will
make me get out of bed at once to let it in. Then I will come to you,
and fail me not, if ever you would speak to me again."
</p>
<p>
"My most dear and loyal sweetheart," said Monseigneur, "I thank you all
I can. Be sure that I will fail not to be there."
</p>
<p>
Then he rose and went away, and the lady also; each thinking and
desiring how to carry out the proposed plan.
</p>
<p>
What need of a long story? The greyhound wanted to come into the chamber
of his mistress at the usual time, as it had been accustomed, but the
damsel had condemned it to banishment, and it was quickly made to beat a
retreat. The Queen went to bed without noticing the absence of the dog,
and soon afterwards there came to keep her company, the gentle damsel,
who was only waiting to hear the greyhound cry out as the signal for the
battle.
</p>
<p>
It was not long before the worthy lord set to work, and soon managed to
reach the chamber where the greyhound was sleeping. He felt for it, with
his foot or with his hand, until he found it, then he took it by the
ears and made it cry aloud two or three times.
</p>
<p>
The Queen, who heard it, soon knew that it was her greyhound, and
thought that it wanted to come in. She called the damsel, and said;
</p>
<p>
"My dear, my greyhound is howling outside. Get up, and let it in!"
</p>
<p>
"Willingly, madam," said the damsel, and as she awaited the battle, the
day and hour of which she had herself appointed, she only armed herself
with her chemise, and in that guise, came to the door and opened it, and
soon met with him who was awaiting her.
</p>
<p>
He was so delighted and so surprised to see his ladylove so beautiful,
and so well-prepared for the encounter, that he lost his strength and
sense, and had not force enough left to draw his dagger, and try whether
it could penetrate her cuirass. Of kissing, and cuddling, and
playing with her breasts, he could do plenty; but for the grand
operation&mdash;nihil.
</p>
<p>
So the fair damsel was forced to return without leaving him that which
he could not gain by force of arms. But when she would quit him, he
tried to detain her by force and by soft speeches, but she dared not
stay, so she shut the door in his face, and came back to the Queen, who
asked her if she had let the greyhound in? And she said, "No, because
she could not find it though she had looked well for it."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, well" said the Queen, "go to bed. It will be all right."
</p>
<p>
The poor lover was very dissatisfied with himself, and thought himself
dishonoured and disgraced, for he had up till then had such confidence
in himself that he believed he could in less than one hour have tackled
three ladies, and come off every time with honour.
</p>
<p>
At last his courage returned, and he said to himself that if he
ever were so fortunate as to find another such opportunity with his
sweetheart, she should not escape as she did the previous time.
</p>
<p>
Thus animated and spurred on by shame and desire, he again took the
greyhound by the ears, and made it cry out much louder than it had
before.
</p>
<p>
Awakened by this cry, the Queen again sent her damsel, who opened the
door as before, but had to return to her mistress without getting any
more pleasure than she had the first time.
</p>
<p>
A third time did the poor gentleman do all in his power to tumble her,
but the devil a bit could he find a lance to encounter her with, though
she awaited his onslaught with a firm foot. And when she saw that she
could not have her basket pierced, and that he could not lay his lance
in rest, whatever advantage she gave him, she knew that the joust had
come to nothing, and had a very poor opinion of the jouster.
</p>
<p>
She would no longer stay with him for all that he could say or do. She
wished to return to the chamber, but her lover held her by force and
said;
</p>
<p>
"Alas, sweetheart, stay a little longer, I pray!"
</p>
<p>
"I cannot," she said: "let me go! I have stayed too long already,
considering the little I got by it," and with that she turned towards
the chamber, but he followed her and tried to detain her.
</p>
<p>
When she saw that&mdash;to pay him out, and also hoodwink the Queen&mdash;she
called out loud,
</p>
<p>
"Get out! get out! dirty beast that you are! By God! you shall not come
in here, dirty beast that you are!" and so saying she closed the door.
</p>
<p>
The Queen, who heard it, asked,
</p>
<p>
"To whom are you speaking, my dear?"
</p>
<p>
"To this dirty dog, madam, who has given me such trouble to look for
him. He was lying quite flat, and with his nose on the ground, hidden
under a bench, so that I could not find him. And when I did find him he
would not get up for anything that I could do. I would willingly have
put him in, but he would not deign to lift up his head, so, in disgust,
I have shut the door upon him and left him outside."
</p>
<p>
"You did quite right, my dear," said the Queen. "Come to bed, and go to
sleep!"
</p>
<p>
Such, as you have heard, was the bad luck of this noble lord; and since
he could not when his lady would, I believe that since then, when he had
the power, his lady's will was not to be had.

<i>Of a gentleman to whom&mdash;the first night that he was married, and after
he had but tried one stroke&mdash;his wife brought forth a child, and of

<p>
It is not a hundred years ago since a young gentleman of this country
wished to know and experience the joys of matrimony, and&mdash;to cut matters

</p>
<p>
After much good cheer and the usual amusements, the bride was put to
bed, and a short time afterwards her husband followed, and lay close to
her, and without delay duly began the assault on her fortress. With some
trouble he entered in and gained the stronghold, but you must understand
that he did not complete the conquest without accomplishing many feats
of arms which it would take long to enumerate; for before he came to the
donjon of the castle he had other outworks, with which it was provided,
to carry, like a place that had never been taken or was still quite new,
and which nature had provided with many defences.
</p>
<p>
When he was master of the place, he broke his lance, and ceased the
assault. But the fair damsel when she saw herself at the mercy of her
husband, and how he had foraged the greater part of her manor, wished
to show him a prisoner whom she held confined in a secret place,&mdash;or to
speak plainly she was delivered on the spot, after this first encounter,
of a fine boy; at which her husband was so ashamed and so astonished
that he did not know what to do except to hold his tongue.
</p>
<p>
Out of kindness and pity, he did all that he possibly could for both
mother and child, but, as you may believe, the poor woman could not
restrain from uttering a loud cry when the child was born. Many persons
heard this cry, and believed that it was "the cry of the maidenhead,"
(*) which is a custom of this country.
</p>
<pre>
     (*) A singular custom which obliged the bride to utter a
     loud cry when she lost her virginity, and to which the
     groomsmen replied by bringing a large bowl of caudle or some
     invigorating drink into the bed chamber. From some verses
     written by Clement Marot on the marriage of the Duke of
     Ferrara to Princess Rénée, it would appear that the custom
     existed at the Court of France.
</pre>
<p>
Immediately all the gentlemen in the house where the bridegroom resided,
came and knocked at the door of the chamber, and brought the caudle; but
though they knocked loudly they received no reply, for the bride was in
a condition in which silence is excusable, and the bridegroom had not
much to chatter about.
</p>
<p>
"What is the matter?" cried the guests. "Why do you not open the door?
If you do not make haste we will break it open; the caudle we have
brought you will be quite cold;" and they began to knock louder than
ever.
</p>
<p>
But the bridegroom would not have uttered a word for a hundred francs;
at which those outside did not know what to think, for he was not
ordinarily a silent man. At last he rose, and put on a dressing-gown he
had, and let in his friends, who soon asked him whether the caudle had
been earned, and what sort of a time he had had? Then one of them
laid the table-cloth, and spread the banquet, for they had everything
prepared, and spared nothing in such cases. They all sat round to eat,
and the bridegroom took his seat in a high-backed chair placed near his
bed, looking very stupid and pitiful as you may imagine. And whatever
the others said, he did not answer a word, but sat there like a statue
or a carved idol.
</p>
<p>
"What is the matter?" cried one. "You take no notice of the excellent
repast that our host has provided. You have not said a single word yet."
</p>
<p>
"Marry!" said another, "he has no jokes ready."
</p>
<p>
"By my soul!" said another, "marriage has wondrous properties. He has
but been married an hour and he has lost his tongue. If he goes on at
that rate there will soon be nothing left of him."
</p>
<p>
To tell the truth, he had formerly been known as a merry fellow, fond of
a joke, and never uttered a word but a jest; but now he was utterly cast
down.
</p>
<p>
The gentlemen drank to the bride and bridegroom, but devil a drop would
either of them quaff in return; the one was in a violent rage, and the
other was far from being at ease.
</p>
<p>
"I am not experienced in these affairs," said a gentleman, "but it seems
we must feast by ourselves. I never saw a man with such a grim-looking
face, and so soon sobered by a woman. You might hear a pin drop in his
company. Marry! his loud jests are small enough now!"
</p>
<p>
"I drink to the bridegroom," said another, but the bridegroom neither
drank, eat, laughed, or spoke. Nevertheless, after some time that he had
been both scolded and teased by his friends, like a wild boar at bay, he
retorted;
</p>
<p>
"Gentlemen, I have listened for some time to your jokes and reproofs. I
would like you to understand that I have good reason to reflect and keep
silent, and I am sure that there is no one here but would do the same
if he had the same reasons that I have. By heavens! if I were as rich
as the King of France, or the Duke of Burgundy, or all the princes of
Christendom, I should not be able to provide that which, apparently, I
shall <i>have</i> to provide. I have but touched my wife once, and she has
brought forth a child! Now if each time that I begin again she does the
same, how shall I be able to keep my family?"
</p>
<p>
"What? a child?" said his friends.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, yes! Really a child! Look here!" and he turned towards the bed and
lifted up the clothes and showed them.
</p>
<p>
"There!" said he. "There is the cow and the calf! Am I not well
swindled?"
</p>
<p>
Many of his friends were much astonished, and quite excused their host's
conduct, and went away each to his own home. And the poor bridegroom
abandoned his newly-delivered bride the first night, fearing that she
would do the same another time, and not knowing what would become of him
if so.

<h2>STORY THE THIRTIETH &mdash; THE THREE CORDELIERS</h2>


<h3>
By Monsigneur de Beauvoir
</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>
Of three merchants of Savoy who went on a pilgrimage to St. Anthony in
Bienne, (*) and who were deceived and cuckolded by three Cordeliers who
slept with their wives. And how the women thought they had been with
their husbands, and how their husbands came to know of it, and of the
steps they took, as you shall shortly hear.
</p>
</blockquote>

<pre>
     (*) This according to M. Lacroix is the old town of La Mothe
     St. Didier in Dauphiné, which took the name of Saint Antoine
     on account of the relics of the Saint, which were brought
     there in the 11th century.
</pre>
<p>
It is as true as the Gospel, that three worthy merchants of Savoy set
out with their wives to go on a pilgrimage to St. Anthony of Vienne. And
in order to render their journey more devout and more agreeable to God
and St. Anthony, they determined that from the time they left their
houses, and all through the journey, they would not sleep with their
wives, but live in continence, both going and returning.
</p>
<p>
They arrived one night in the town, where they found good lodgings, and
had excellent cheer at supper, like those who have plenty of money and
know well what to do with it, and enjoyed themselves so much that each
determined to break his oath, and sleep with his wife.
</p>
<p>
However, it happened otherwise, for when it was time to retire to rest,
the women said good night to their husbands and left them, and shut
themselves up in a chamber near, where each had ordered her bed to be
made.
</p>
<p>
Now you must know that that same evening there arrived in the house
three Cordeliers, who were going to Geneva, and who ordered a chamber
not very far from that of the merchant's wives.
</p>
<p>
The women, when they were alone, began to talk about a hundred thousand
things, and though there were only three of them they made enough noise
for forty.
</p>
<p>
The good Cordeliers, hearing all this womens' chatter, came out of their
chamber, without making any noise, and approached the door without being
heard. They saw three pretty women, each lying by herself in a fair bed,
big enough to accommodate a second bed-fellow; then they saw and heard
also the three husbands go to bed in another chamber, and they said to
themselves that fortune had done them a good turn, and that they would
be unworthy to meet with any other good luck if they were cowardly
enough to allow this opportunity to escape them.
</p>
<p>
"So," said one of them, "there needs no further deliberation as to what
we are to do; we are three and they are three&mdash;let each take his place
when they are asleep."
</p>
<p>
As it was said, so it was done, and such good luck had the good brothers
that they found the key of the room in which the women were, and opened
the door so gently that they were not heard by a soul, and they were not
such fools when they had gained the outworks as not to close the door
after them and take out the key, and then, without more ado, each picked
out a bed-fellow, and began to ruffle her as well as he could.
</p>
<p>
One of the women, believing it was her husband, spoke, and said;
</p>
<p>
"What are you doing? Do you not remember your vow?" But the good
Cordelier answered not a word, but did that for which he came, and did
it so energetically that she could not help assisting in the
performance.
</p>
<p>
The other two also were not idle, and the good women did not know what
had caused their husbands thus to break their vow. Nevertheless, they
thought they ought to obey, and bear it all patiently without speaking,
each being afraid of being heard by her companions, for really each
thought that she alone was getting the benefit.
</p>
<p>
When the good Cordeliers had done all they could, they left without
saying a word, and returned to their chamber, each recounting his
adventures. One had broken three lances; another, four; and the other,
six. They rose early in the morning, and left the town.
</p>
<p>
The good ladies, who had not slept all night, did not rise very early in
the morning, for they fell asleep at daybreak, which caused them to get
up late.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, their husbands, who had supped well the previous
night, and who expected to be called by their wives, slept heavily till
an hour so late that on other days they had generally travelled two
leagues by that time.
</p>
<p>
At last the women got up, and dressed themselves as quickly as they
could, and not without talking. And, amongst other things, the one who
had the longest tongue, said;
</p>
<p>
"Between ourselves, mesdames&mdash;how have you passed the night? Have
your husbands worked like mine did? He has not ceased to ruffle me all
night."
</p>
<p>
"By St. John!" said they, "if your husband ruffled you well last night,
ours have not been idle. They have soon forgotten what they promised at
parting; though believe us we did not forget to remind them."
</p>
<p>
"I warned mine also," said the first speaker, "when he began, but he
did not leave off working, and hurried on like a hungry man who had been
deprived of my company for two nights."
</p>
<p>
When they were attired, they went to find their husbands, who were
already dressed;
</p>
<p>
"Good morning, good morning! you sleepers!" cried the ladies.
</p>
<p>
"Thank you," said the men, "for having called us."
</p>
<p>
"By my oath!" said one lady. "We have no more qualms of conscience for
not calling you than you have for breaking your vow."
</p>
<p>
"What vow?" said one of the men.
</p>
<p>
"The vow," said she, "that you made on leaving, not to sleep with your
wife."
</p>
<p>
"And who has slept with his wife?" asked he. "You know well enough,"
said she, "and so do I."
</p>
<p>
"And I also," said her companion. "Here is my husband who never gave me
such a tumbling as he did last night&mdash;indeed if he had not done his duty
so well I should not be so pleased that he had broken his vow, but I
pass over that, for I suppose he is like young children, who when they
know they deserve punishment, think they may as well be hanged for a
sheep as a lamb."
</p>
<p>
"By St. John! so did mine!" cried the third. "But I am not going to
scold him for it. If there was any harm done there was good reason for
it."
</p>
<p>
"And I declare by my oath," cried one of the men, "that you dream, and
that you are drunken with sleep. As for me I slept alone, and did not
leave my bed all night."
</p>
<p>
"Nor did I," said another.
</p>
<p>
"Nor I, by St. John!" said the third. "I would not on any account break
my oath. And I feel sure that my friend here, and my neighbour there,
who also promised, have not so quickly forgotten."
</p>
<p>
The women began to change colour and to suspect some trickery, when one
of the husbands began to fear the truth. Without giving the women time
to reply, he made a sign to his companions, and said, laughing;
</p>
<p>
"By my oath, madam, the good wine here, and the excellent cheer
last night made us forget our promise; but be not displeased at the
adventure; if it please God we each last night, with your help, made
a fine baby, which is a work of great merit, and will be sufficient to
wipe out the fault of breaking our vow!"
</p>
<p>
"May God will it so!" said the women. "But you so strongly declared that
you had not been near us that we began to doubt a little."
</p>
<p>
"We did it on purpose," said he, "in order to hear what you would say."
</p>
<p>
"And so you committed a double sin; first to break your oath, then to
knowingly lie about it; and also you have much troubled us."
</p>
<p>
"Do not worry yourselves about that," said he; "it is no great matter;
but go to Mass, and we will follow you."
</p>
<p>
The women set out towards the church, and their husbands remained
behind, without following them too closely; then they all said together,
without picking their words;
</p>
<p>
"We are deceived! Those devils of Cordeliers have cuckolded us; they
have taken our places, and shown us the folly of not sleeping with our
wives. They should never have slept out of our rooms, and if it was
dangerous to be in bed with them, is there not plenty of good straw to
be had?"
</p>
<p>
"Marry!" said one of them, "we are well punished this time; but at any
rate it is better that the trick should only be known to us than to
us and our wives, for there would be much danger if it came to their
knowledge. You hear by their confession that these ribald monks have
done marvels&mdash;both more and better than we could do. And, if our wives
knew that, they would not be satisfied with this experience only. My
advice is that we swallow the business without chewing it."
</p>
<p>
"So help me God!" cried the third, "my friend speaks well. As for me, I
revoke my vow, for it is not my intention to run any more risks."
</p>
<p>
"As you will," said the other two; "and we will follow your example."
</p>
<p>
So all the rest of the journey the wives slept with their husbands,
though the latter took care not to explain the cause. And when the
women saw that, they demanded the cause of this sudden change. And they
answered deceitfully, that as they had begun to break their vow they had
better go on.
</p>
<p>
Thus were the three worthy merchants deceived by the three good
Cordeliers, without it ever coming to the knowledge of their wives, who
would have died of grief had they known the truth; for every day we see
women die for less cause and occasion.

<h2>
    STORY THE THIRTY-FIRST &mdash; TWO LOVERS FOR ONE LADY. <a href="#note-31" name="noteref-31">31</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur De La Barde.
</h3>
<p>
<i>Of a squire who found the mule of his companion, and mounted thereon
and it took him to the house of his master's mistress; and the squire
slept there, where his friend found him; also of the words which passed
between them&mdash;as is more clearly set out below.</i>
</p>
<p>
A gentleman of this kingdom&mdash;a squire of great renown and
reputation&mdash;fell in love with a beautiful damsel of Rouen, and did all
in his power to gain her good graces. But fortune was contrary to
him, and his lady so unkind, that finally he abandoned the pursuit in
despair.
</p>
<p>
He was not very wrong to do so, for she was provided with a lover&mdash;not
that the squire knew of that, however much he might suspect it.
</p>
<p>
He who enjoyed her love was a knight, and a man of great authority,
and was so familiar with the squire as to tell him much concerning his
love-affair. Often the knight said; "By my faith, friend, I would have
you know that I have a mistress in this town to whom I am devoted; for,
however tired I may be, I would willingly go three or four leagues to
see her&mdash;a mere couple of leagues I would run over without stopping to
take breath."
</p>
<p>
"Is there no request or prayer that I can make" said the squire, "that
will cause you to tell me her name?"
</p>
<p>
"No, no!" said the other, "you shall not know that."
</p>
<p>
"Well!" said the squire, "when I am so fortunate as to have something
good, I will be as reticent as you are."
</p>
<p>
It happened some time after this that the good knight asked the squire
to supper at the castle of Rouen, where he was then lodged. He came, and
they had some talk; the gentle knight, who had an appointment to see his
lady at a certain hour, said farewell to the squire, and added,
</p>
<p>
"You know that we have various things to see to to-morrow, and that we
must rise early in order to arrange various matters. It is advisable
therefore to go to bed early, and for that reason I bid you goodnight."
</p>
<p>
The squire, who was cunning enough, suspected that the good knight
wished to go somewhere, and that he was making the duties of the morrow
an excuse to get rid of him, but he took no notice, and on taking leave
and wishing good-night to his host, said;
</p>
<p>
"Monseigneur you say well; rise early to-morrow morning, and I will do
the same."
</p>
<p>
When the good squire went down, he found a little mule at the foot of
the staircase of the castle, with no one minding it. He soon guessed
that the page he had met as he came down had gone to seek for a
saddle-cloth for his master.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, ah" he said to himself, "my host did not get rid of me at this
early hour for nothing. Here is his mule, which only waits till I am
gone to carry his master to some place he does not wish me to know. Ah,
mule!" said he, "if you could speak, you could tell me some news. Let me
beg of you to lead me where your master wishes to be."
</p>
<p>
With that he made his page hold the stirrup, and mounted the mule,
and laid the reins on the mule's neck, and let it amble on wherever it
liked.
</p>
<p>
And the little mule led him by streets and alleys here and there, till
at last it stopped before a little wicket, which was in a side street
where its master was accustomed to come, and which was the garden
gate of the house of the very damsel the squire had so loved and had
abandoned in despair.
</p>
<p>
He dismounted, and tapped gently at the wicket, and a damsel, who was
watching through a hidden lattice, believing it to be the knight, came
down and opened the door, and said;
</p>
<p>
"Monseigneur you are welcome; mademoiselle is in her chamber, and awaits
you."
</p>
<p>
She did not recognise him, because it was late, and he had a velvet cap
drawn down over his face. And the good squire replied, "I will go to
her."
</p>
<p>
The he whispered to his page, "Go quickly and put the mule where we
found it; then go to bed."
</p>
<p>
"It shall be done, sir," he said.
</p>
<p>
The woman closed the gate, and led the way to the chamber. Our good
squire, much occupied with the business in hand, walked boldly to the
room where the lady was, and he found her simply dressed in a plain
petticoat, and with a gold chain round her neck.
</p>
<p>
He saluted her politely, for he was kind, courteous and well-spoken, but
she, who was as much astonished as though horns had sprouted out of her
head, did not for the moment know how to reply, but at last she asked
him what he sought there, why he came at that hour, and who had sent
him?
</p>
<p>
"Mademoiselle," said he, "you may well imagine that if I had had to rely
on myself alone I should not be here; but, thank God, one who has more
pity for me than you ever had, has done this kindness to me."
</p>
<p>
"Who brought you here, sir?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"By my oath, mademoiselle, I will not conceal that from you; it was such
and such a lord (and he named the knight who had invited him to supper),
who sent me here."
</p>
<p>
"Ah!" she cried. "Traitor and disloyal knight that he is, has he
betrayed my confidence? Well, well! I will be revenged on him some day."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, mademoiselle! it is not right of you to say that, for it is no
treason to give pleasure to one's friend, or to render him aid and
service when one can. You know what a great friendship exists between
him and me, and that neither hides from the other what is in his heart.
It happened that not long ago I related and confessed to him the great
love I bore you, and that because of you I had no happiness left in the
world, for that by no means could I ever win your affection, and that it
was not possible for me to long endure this horrible martyrdom. When the
good knight knew that my words were really true, and was aware of the
sorrow I endured, he was fain to tell me how he stood with regard to
you, and preferred to lose you, and so save my life, than to see me die
miserably and retain your affection. And if you are such a woman as you
should be, you would not hesitate to give comfort and consolation to me,
your obedient servant, who has always loyally served and obeyed you."
</p>
<p>
"I beg of you," she said, "not to speak of that, and to leave here at
once. Cursed be he who made you come!"
</p>
<p>
"Do you know, mademoiselle," he replied, "that it is not my intention to
leave here before to-morrow morning?"
</p>
<p>
"By my oath," she cried, "you will go now, at once!"
</p>
<p>
"Morbleu! I will not&mdash;for I will sleep with you."
</p>
<p>
When she saw that he was not to be got rid of by hard words, she
resolved to try kindness, and said;
</p>
<p>
"I beg of you with all my heart to leave my house now, and by my oath,
another time I will do whatever you wish."
</p>
<p>
"Bah!" said he; "Waste no more words, for I shall sleep here," and
with that he removed his cloak, and led the damsel to the table, and
finally&mdash;to cut the tale short&mdash;she went to bed with him by her side.
</p>
<p>
They had not been in bed long, and he had but broken one lance, when
the good knight arrived on his mule, and knocked at the wicket. When the
squire heard that and knew who it was, he began to growl, imitating a
dog very well.
</p>
<p>
The knight, hearing this, was both astonished and angry. He knocked
at the door more loudly than before, and the other growled louder than
ever.
</p>
<p>
"Who is that growling?" said he outside. "Morbleu! but I will soon find
out! Open the door, or I will carry it away!"
</p>
<p>
The fair damsel, who was in a great rage, went to the window in her
chemise, and said;
</p>
<p>
"Are you there, false and disloyal knight? You may knock as much as you
like, but you will not come in!"
</p>
<p>
"Why shall I not come in?" said he.
</p>
<p>
"Because," said she, "you are the falsest man that ever woman met, and
are not worthy to be with respectable people."
</p>
<p>
"Mademoiselle," said he, "you blason my arms very well, but I do not
know what excites you, for I have never been false to you that I am
aware of."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, you have," she cried, "done me the greatest wrong that ever man
did to woman."
</p>
<p>
"I have not, I swear. But tell me who is in there?"
</p>
<p>
"You know very well, wretched traitor that you are," she replied.
</p>
<p>
Thereupon the squire, who was in bed, began to growl like a dog as
before.
</p>
<p>
"Marry!" said he outside, "I do not understand this. Who is this
growler?"
</p>
<p>
"By St. John! you shall know," cried the other, and jumped out of bed
and came to the window, and said;
</p>
<p>
"And please you, sir, you have no right to wake us up."
</p>
<p>
The good knight, when he knew who spoke to him, was marvellously
astonished, and when at last he spoke, he said.
</p>
<p>
"How did you come here?"
</p>
<p>
"I supped at your house and slept here."
</p>
<p>
"The fault is mine," said he. Then addressing the damsel, he added,
"Mademoiselle, do you harbour such guests in your house?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, monseigneur," she replied, "and thank you for having sent him."
</p>
<p>
"I?" said he. "By St. John I have nothing to do with it. I came to
occupy my usual place, but it seems I am too late. At least I beg, since
I cannot have anything else, that you open the door and let me drink a
cup of wine."
</p>
<p>
"By God, you shall not enter here!" she cried.
</p>
<p>
"By St. John! he shall," cried the squire, and ran down and opened the
door, and then went back to bed, and she did also, though, God knows,
much ashamed and dissatisfied.
</p>
<p>
When the good knight entered the chamber, he lighted a candle, and
looked at the couple in bed and said;
</p>
<p>
"Good luck to you, mademoiselle, and to you also squire."
</p>
<p>
"Many thanks, monseigneur," said he.
</p>
<p>
But the damsel could not say a word, her heart was so full, for she felt
certain that the knight had connived at the squire's coming, and she
felt so angry that she would not speak to him.
</p>
<p>
"Who showed you the way here, squire?" asked the knight.
</p>
<p>
"Your little mule, monseigneur," said he. "I found it at the foot of the
stairs, when I supped with you at the castle. It was there alone, and
seemingly lost, so I asked it what it was waiting for, and it replied
that it was waiting for its saddle-cloth and you. 'To go where?' I
asked. 'Where we usually go,' replied the mule. 'I am sure,' said I,
'that your master will not leave the house to-night, for he is going
to bed, so take me where you usually go, I beg.' It was content, so I
mounted on it, and it brought me here, for which I give it thanks."
</p>
<p>
"God reward the little beast that betrayed me," said the good knight.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, you have fully deserved it, monseigneur," said the damsel, when at
last she was able to speak. "I know well that you have deceived me,
but I wish you to know that it is not much to your honour. There was
no need, if you would not come yourself, to send some one else
surreptitiously. It was an evil day for me when first I saw you."
</p>
<p>
"Morbleu! I never sent him," he said; "but since he is here I will not
drive him away. Besides there is enough for the two of us; is there not
my friend?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, yes, monseigneur, plenty of spoil to divide. Let us celebrate the
arrangement by a drink."
</p>
<p>
He went to the side-board and filled a large cup with wine, and said, "I
drink to you, friend."
</p>
<p>
"And I pledge you, friend," said the other, and poured out another cup
for the damsel, who refused to drink, but at last, unwillingly, kissed
the cup.
</p>
<p>
"Well, friend," said the knight, "I will leave you here. Ruffle her
well; it is your turn to-day and will be mine to morrow, please God, and
I hope you will be as obliging to me, if ever you find me here, as I am
to you now."
</p>
<p>
"By Our Lady, friend, doubt not but I shall be."
</p>
<p>
Then the knight went away and left the squire, who did as well as he
could on the first night. And he told the damsel the whole truth of his
adventure, at which she was somewhat relieved to find that he had not
been sent.
</p>
<p>
Thus was the fair damsel deceived by the mule, and obliged to obey the
knight and the squire, each in his turn&mdash;an arrangement to which she
finally became accustomed. The knight and squire grew more attached to
each other than before this adventure; their affection increased, and no
evil counsels engendered discord and hate between them.

<h2>
    STORY THE THIRTY-SECOND &mdash; THE WOMEN WHO PAID TITHE. <a href="#note-32" name="noteref-32">32</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur De Villiers.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of the Cordeliers of Ostelleria in Catalonia, who took tithe from the
women of the town, and how it was known, and the punishment the lord of
that place and his subjects inflicted on the monks, as you shall learn
hereafter.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In order that I may not be excluded from the number of fortunate and
meritorious writers who have worked to increase the number of stories
in this book, I will briefly relate a new story, which will serve as a
substitute for the tale previously required of me.
</p>
<p>
It is a well-known fact that in the town of Hostelleria, in Catalonia,
(*) there arrived some minor friars of the order of Observance, (**) who
had been driven out of the kingdom of Spain.
</p>
<pre>
     (*) Hostalrich, a town of Catalonia, some 28 miles from
     Girona.

     (**) One of the principal branches of the order of
     Franciscans.
</pre>
<p>
They managed to worm themselves into the good graces of the Lord of that
town, who was an old man, so that he built for them a fair church and a
large convent, and maintained and supported them all his life as best he
could. And after him came his eldest son, who did quite as much for them
as his worthy father had done.
</p>
<p>
In fact they prospered so, that, in a few years they had everything that
a convent of mendicant friars could desire. Nor were they idle during
all the time they were acquiring these riches; they preached both in the
town and in the neighbouring villages, and had such influence over the
people that there was not a good christian who did not confess to them,
they had such great renown for pointing out faults to sinners.
</p>
<p>
But of all who praised them and held them in esteem, the women were
foremost, such saints did they deem them on account of their charity and
devotion.
</p>
<p>
Now listen to the wickedness, deception, and horrible treason which
these false hypocrites practised on the men and women who every day gave
them so many good gifts. They made it known to all the women in the town
that they were to give to God a tenth of all their goods.
</p>
<p>
"You render to your Lord such and such a thing; to your parish and
priest such and such a thing; and to us you must render and deliver the
tithe of the number of times that you have carnal connection with your
husband. We will take no other tithe from you, for, as you know, we
carry no money&mdash;for the temporal and transitory things of this world are
nothing to us. We ask and demand only spiritual goods. The tithes
which we ask and which you owe us are not temporal goods; as the Holy
Sacrament, which you receive, is a divine and holy thing, so no one may
receive the tithe but us, who are monks of the order of the Observance."
</p>
<p>
The poor simple women, who believed the good friars were more like
angels than terrestrial beings, did not refuse to pay the tithe. There
was not one who did not pay in her turn, from the highest to the lowest,
even the wife of the Lord was not excused.
</p>
<p>
Thus were all the women of the town parcelled out amongst these rascally
monks, and there was not a monk who did not have fifteen or sixteen
women to pay tithes to him, and God knows what other presents they had
from the women, and all under cover of devotion.
</p>
<p>
This state of affairs lasted long without its ever coming to the
knowledge of those who were most concerned in the payment of the new
tithe; but at last it was discovered in the following manner.
</p>
<p>
A young man who was newly married, was invited to supper at the house of
one of his relations&mdash;he and his wife&mdash;and as they were returning home,
and passing the church of the above-mentioned good Cordeliers, suddenly
the bell rang out the <i>Ave Maria</i>, and the young man bowed to the ground
to say his prayers.
</p>
<p>
His wife said, "I would willingly enter this church."
</p>
<p>
"What would you do in there at this hour?" asked her husband. "You can
easily come again when it is daylight; to-morrow, or some other time."
</p>
<p>
"I beg of you," she said, "to let me go: I will soon return."
</p>
<p>
"By Our Lady!" said he, "you shall not go in now."
</p>
<p>
"By my oath!" she replied, "it is compulsory. I must go in, but I will
not stay. If you are in a hurry to get home, go on, and I will follow
you directly."
</p>
<p>
"Get on! get forward!" he said, "you have nothing to do here. If you
want to say a <i>Pater noster</i>, or an <i>Ave Maria</i>, there is plenty of room
at home, and it is quite as good to say it there as in this monastery,
which is now as dark as pitch."
</p>
<p>
"Marry!" said she, "you may say what you like, but by my oath, it is
necessary that I should enter here for a little while."
</p>
<p>
"Why?" said he. "Do you want to sleep with any of the brothers."
</p>
<p>
She imagined that her husband knew that she paid the tithe, and replied;
</p>
<p>
"No, I do not want to sleep with him; I only want to pay."
</p>
<p>
"Pay what?" said he.
</p>
<p>
"You know very well," she answered; "Why do you ask?"
</p>
<p>
"What do I know well?" he asked, "I never meddle with your debts."
</p>
<p>
"At least," she said, "you know very well that I must pay the tithe."
</p>
<p>
"What tithe?"
</p>
<p>
"Marry!" she replied. "It always has to be paid;&mdash;the tithe for our
nights together. You are lucky&mdash;I have to pay for us both."
</p>
<p>
"And to whom do you pay?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"To brother Eustace," she replied. "You go on home, and let me go in and
discharge my debt. It is a great sin not to pay, and I am never at ease
in my mind when I owe him anything."
</p>
<p>
"It is too late to-night," said he, "he has gone to bed an hour ago."
</p>
<p>
"By my oath," said she, "I have been this year later than this. If one
wants to pay one can go in at any hour."
</p>
<p>
"Come along! come along!" he said. "One night makes no such great
matter."
</p>
<p>
So they returned home; both husband and wife vexed and displeased&mdash;the
wife because she was not allowed to pay her tithe, and the husband
because he had learned how he had been deceived, and was filled with
anger and thoughts of vengeance, rendered doubly bitter by the fact that
he did not dare to show his anger.
</p>
<p>
A little later they went to bed together, and the husband, who was
cunning enough, questioned his wife indirectly, and asked if the other
women of the town paid tithes as she did?
</p>
<p>
"By my faith they do," she replied. "What privilege should they have
more than me? There are sixteen to twenty of us who pay brother Eustace.
Ah, he is so devout. And he has so much patience. Brother Bartholomew
has as many or more, and amongst others my lady (*) is of the number.
Brother Jacques also has many; Brother Anthony also&mdash;there is not one of
them who has not a number."
</p>
<pre>
     (*) The wife of the Seigneur.
</pre>
<p>
"St. John!" said the husband, "they do not do their work by halves. Now
I understand well that they are more holy than I thought them; and truly
I will invite them all to my house, one after the other, to feast them
and hear their good words. And since Brother Eustace receives your
tithes, he shall be the first. See that we have a good dinner to-morrow,
and I will bring him."
</p>
<p>
"Most willingly," she replied, "for then at all events I shall not have
to go to his chamber to pay him; he can receive it when he comes here."
</p>
<p>
"Well said," he replied; "give it him here;" but as you may imagine he
was on his guard, and instead of sleeping all night, thought over at his
leisure the plan he intended to carry out on the morrow.
</p>
<p>
The dinner arrived, and Brother Eustace, who did not know his host's
intentions stuffed a good meal under his hood. And when he had well
eaten, he rolled his eyes on his hostess, and did not spare to press her
foot under the table&mdash;all of which the host saw, though he pretended not
to, however much to his prejudice it was.
</p>
<p>
After the meal was over and grace was said, he called Brother Eustace
and told him that he wanted to show him an image of Our Lady that he had
in his chamber, and the monk replied that he would willingly come.
</p>
<p>
They both entered the chamber, and the host closed the door so that
he could not leave, and then laying hold of a big axe, said to the
Cordelier.
</p>
<p>
"By God's death, father! you shall never go out of this room&mdash;unless it
be feet foremost&mdash;if you do not confess the truth."
</p>
<p>
"Alas, my host, I beg for mercy. What is it you, would ask of me?"
</p>
<p>
"I ask," said he, "the tithe of the tithe you have received from my
wife."
</p>
<p>
When the Cordelier heard the word tithes, he began to think that he was
in a fix, and did not know what to reply except to beg for mercy, and to
excuse himself as well as he could.
</p>
<p>
"Now tell me," said the husband, "what tithe it is that you take from my
wife and the others?"
</p>
<p>
The poor Cordelier was so frightened that he could not speak, and
answered never a word.
</p>
<p>
"Tell me all about it," said the young man, "and I swear to you I will
let you go and do you no harm;&mdash;but if you do not confess I will kill
you stone dead."
</p>
<p>
When the other felt convinced that he had better confess his sin and
that of his companions and escape, than conceal the facts and be in
danger of losing his life, he said;
</p>
<p>
"My host, I beg for mercy, and I will tell you the truth. It is true
that my companions and I have made all the women of this town believe
that they owe us tithes for all the times their husbands sleep with
them. They believed us, and they all pay&mdash;young and old&mdash;when once they
are married. There is not one that is excused&mdash;my lady even pays like
the others&mdash;her two nieces also&mdash;and in general there is no one that is
exempt."
</p>
<p>
"Marry!" said the other, "since my lord and other great folks pay it, I
ought not to be dissatisfied, however much I may dislike it. Well! you
may go, worthy father, on this condition&mdash;that you do not attempt to
collect the tithe that my wife owes you."
</p>
<p>
The other was never so joyous as when he found himself outside the
house, and said to himself that he would never ask for anything of the
kind again, nor did he, as you will hear.
</p>
<p>
When the host of the Cordelier was informed by his wife of this new
tithe, he went to his Lord and told him all about the tax and how it
concerned him. You may imagine that he was much astonished, and said;
</p>
<p>
"Ah, cursed wretches that they are! Cursed be the hour that ever my
father&mdash;whom may God pardon&mdash;received them! And now they take our spoils
and dishonour us, and ere long they may do worse. What is to be done?"
</p>
<p>
"By my faith, Monseigneur" said the other, "if it please you and seem
good to you, you should assemble all your subjects in this town, for
the matter touches them as much as you. Inform them of this affair, and
consult with them what remedy can be devised before it is too late."
</p>
<p>
Monseigneur approved, and ordered all his married subjects to come to
him, and in the great hall of his castle, he showed them at full length
why he had called them together.
</p>
<p>
If my lord had been astonished and surprised when he heard the news,
so also were all the good people who were there assembled. Some of them
said, "We ought to kill them," others "They should be hanged!" others
"Drown them!" Others said they could not believe it was true&mdash;the monks
were so devout and led such holy lives. One said one thing, another said
another.
</p>
<p>
"I will tell you," said the Seigneur, "what we will do. We will bring
our wives hither, and Master John, or some other, shall preach a little
sermon in which he will take care to make allusion to tithes, and ask
the women, in the name of all of us, whether they discharge their debts,
as we are anxious they should be paid, and we shall hear their reply."
</p>
<p>
After some discussion they all agreed to the Seigneur's proposal. So
orders were issued to all the married women of the town, and they all
came to the great hall, where their husbands were assembled. My lord
even brought my lady, who was quite astonished to see so many persons.
An usher of my lord's commanded silence, and Master John, who was
slightly raised above the other people, began the address which follows;
</p>
<p>
"Mesdames and mesdemoiselles, I am charged by my lord and those of his
council to explain briefly the reason why you are called together. It
is true that my lord, his council, and all his people who are here met
together, desire to make a public examination of their conscience,&mdash;the
cause being that that they wish (God willing) to make ere long a holy
procession in praise of Our Lord Jesus Christ, and His Glorious Mother,
and from the present moment to be in such a devout frame of mind that
they may the better praise him in their prayers, and that all the works
which they do may be most agreeable to God. You know that there have
been no wars in our time, and that our neighbours have been terribly
afflicted both by pestilence and famine. Whilst others have been cast
down, we have nothing to complain of, and we must own that God has
preserved us. There is good reason that we should acknowledge that this
is not due to our own virtues, but to the great and liberal mercy of
our Blessed Redeemer, who cries, calls, and invites us to put up in our
parish church, devout prayers, to which we are to add great faith and
firm devotion. The holy convent of the Cordeliers in this town has
greatly aided, and still aids us in preserving the above-mentioned
benefits. Moreover, we wish to know if you women also perform that
which you have undertaken, and whether you sufficiently remember the
obligation you owe the Church, and therefore it will be advisable that,
by way of precaution, I should mention the principal points. Four times
a year,&mdash;that is to say at the four Natales (*) you must confess to some
priest or monk having the power of absolution, and if at each festival
you receive your Creator that will be well done, but twice, or at least
once a year, you ought to receive the Communion. Bring an offering every
Sunday to each Mass; those who are able should freely give tithes to
God&mdash;as fruit, poultry, lambs, pigs, and other accustomed gifts. You owe
also another tithe to the holy monks of the convent of St. Francis, and
which we earnestly desire to see paid. It greatly concerns us, and we
desire it to be continued, nevertheless there are many of you who
have not acted properly in this respect, and who by negligence, or
backwardness, have neglected to pay in advance. You know that the good
monks cannot come to your houses to seek their tithes;&mdash;that would
disturb and trouble them too much; it is quite enough if they take the
trouble to receive it. It is important that this should be mentioned&mdash;it
remains to see who have paid, and who still owe."
</p>
<pre>
     (*) The four principal festivals in the life of Christ&mdash;
     Christmas, Easter, Whitsuntide, and Ascension.
</pre>
<p>
Master John had no sooner finished his discourse, than more than twenty
women began to cry at the same time, "I have paid!" "I have paid!"
"I owe nothing!" "Nor I," "Nor I." A hundred other voices chimed
in&mdash;generally to say that they owed nothing&mdash;and four or six pretty
young women were even heard to declare that they had paid well in
advance, one four times; one, six; and another, ten.
</p>
<p>
There were also I know not how many old women who said not a word, and
Master John asked them if they had paid their tithe, and they replied
that they had made an arrangement with the Cordeliers.
</p>
<p>
"What!" said he, "you do not pay? You ought to advise and persuade the
others to do their duty, and you yourselves are in default!"
</p>
<p>
"Marry!" said one of them, "I am not to blame. I have been several times
to perform my duty, but my confessor would not listen to me: he always
says he is too busy."
</p>
<p>
"St. John!" said the other old women, "we have compounded with the monks
to pay them the tithe we owe them in linen, cloth, cushions, quilts,
pillow-cases and such other trifles; and that by their own instructions
and desire, for we should prefer to pay like the others."
</p>
<p>
"By Our Lady!" said Master John, "there is no harm done; it is quite
right.
</p>
<p>
"I suppose they can go away now; can they not?" said the Seigneur to
Master John.
</p>
<p>
"Yes!" said he, "but let them be sure and not forget to pay the tithe."
</p>
<p>
When they had all left the hall, the door was closed, and every man
present looked hard at his neighbour.
</p>
<p>
"Well!" said the Seigneur. "What is to be done? We know for certain what
these ribald monks have done to us, by the confession of one of them,
and by our wives; we need no further witness."
</p>
<p>
After many and various opinions, it was resolved to set the convent on
fire, and burn both monks and monastery.
</p>
<p>
They went to the bottom of the town, and came to the monastery, and took
away the <i>Corpus Domini</i> and all the relics and sent them to the parish
church. Then without more ado, they set fire to the convent in several
places, and did not leave till all was consumed&mdash;monks, convent, church,
dormitory, and all the other buildings, of which there were plenty. So
the poor Cordeliers had to pay very dearly for the new tithe they had
levied. Even God could do nothing, but had His house burned down.

<h2>
    STORY THE THIRTY-THIRD &mdash; THE LADY WHO LOST HER HAIR.
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a noble lord who was in love with a damsel who cared for another
great lord, but tried to keep it secret; and of the agreement made
between the two lovers concerning her, as you shall hereafter hear.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A noble knight who lived in the marches of Burgundy, who was wise,
valiant, much esteemed, and worthy of the great reputation he had, was
so much in the graces of a fair damsel, that he was esteemed as her
lover, and obtained from her, at sundry times, all the favours that she
could honourably give him. She was also smitten with a great and noble
lord, a prudent man, whose name and qualities I pass over, though if I
were to recount them there is not one of you who would not recognise the
person intended, which I do not wish.
</p>
<p>
This gentle lord, I say, soon perceived the love affair of the valiant
gentleman just named, and asked him if he were not in the good graces of
such and such a damsel,&mdash;that is to say the lady before mentioned.
</p>
<p>
He replied that he was not, but the other, who knew the contrary to be
case, said that he was sure he was,
</p>
<p>
"For whatever he might say or do, he should not try to conceal such a
circumstance, for if the like or anything more important had occurred to
him (the speaker) he would not have concealed it."
</p>
<p>
And having nothing else to do, and to pass the time, he found means to
make her fall in love with him. In which he succeeded, for in a very
short time he was high in her graces and could boast of having obtained
her favours without any trouble to win them.
</p>
<p>
The other did not expect to have a companion, but you must not think
that the fair wench did not treat him as well or better than before,
which encouraged him in his foolish love. And you must know that the
brave wench was not idle, for she entertained the two at once, and would
with much regret have lost either, and more especially the last-comer,
for he was of better estate and furnished with a bigger lance than her
first lover; and she always assigned them different times to come, one
after the other, as for instance one to-day and the other to-morrow.
</p>
<p>
The last-comer knew very well what she was doing, but he pretended
not to, and in fact he cared very little, except that he was rather
disgusted at the folly of the first-comer, who esteemed too highly a
thing of little value.
</p>
<p>
So he made up his mind that he would warn his rival, which he did. He
knew that the days on which the wench had forbidden him to come to
her (which displeased him much) were reserved for his friend the
first-comer. He kept watch several nights, and saw his rival enter by
the same door and at the same hour as he did himself on the other days.
</p>
<p>
One day he said to him, "You well concealed your amours with such an
one. I am rather astonished that you had so little confidence in me,
considering what I know to be really the case between you and her. And
in order that you may understand that I know all, let me tell you that
I saw you enter her house at such and such an hour, and indeed no longer
ago than yesterday I had an eye upon you, and from a place where I was,
I saw you arrive&mdash;you know whether I speak the truth."
</p>
<p>
When the first-comer heard this accusation, he did not know what to say,
and he was forced to confess what he would have willingly concealed,
and which he thought no one knew but himself; and he told the last-comer
that he would not conceal the fact that he was in love, but begged him
not to make it known.
</p>
<p>
"And what would you say," asked the other, "if you found you had a
companion?"
</p>
<p>
"Companion?" said he; "What companion? In a love affair? I never thought
of it."
</p>
<p>
"By St. John!" said the last-comer, "I ought not to keep you longer in
suspense&mdash;it is I. And since I see that you are in love with a woman
who is not worth it, and if I had not more pity on you than you have on
yourself I should leave you in your folly, but I cannot suffer such a
wench to deceive you and me so long."
</p>
<p>
If any one was astonished at this news it was the first-comer who
believed himself firmly established in the good graces of the wench, and
that she loved no one but him. He did not know what to say or think, and
for a long time could not speak a word. When at last he spoke, he said,
</p>
<p>
"By Our Lady! they have given me the onion (*) and I never suspected it.
I was easily enough deceived. May the devil carry away the wench, just
as she is!"
</p>
<pre>
      (*) i.e. "they have made a fool of me."
</pre>
<p>
"She has fooled the two of us," said the last-comer;
</p>
<p>
"at least she has begun well,&mdash;but we must even fool her."
</p>
<p>
"Do so I beg," said the first. "St. Anthony's fire burn me if ever I see
the jade again."
</p>
<p>
"You know," said the second, "that we go to her each in turn. Well, the
next time that you go, you must tell her that you well know that I am
in love with her, and that you have seen me enter her house at such an
hour, and dressed in such a manner, and that, by heaven, if ever you
find me there again you will kill me stone dead, whatever may happen to
you. I will say the same thing about you, and we shall then see what she
will say and do, and then we shall know how to act."
</p>
<p>
"Well said, and just what I would wish," said the first.
</p>
<p>
As it was arranged, so was it done, for some days later it was the
last-comer's turn to go and visit her; he set out and came to the place
appointed.
</p>
<p>
When he was alone with the wench, who received him very kindly and
lovingly it appeared, he put on&mdash;as he well knew how&mdash;a troubled,
bothered air, and pretended to be very angry. She, who had been
accustomed to see him quite otherwise, did not know what to think, and
she asked what was the matter, for his manner showed that his heart was
not at ease.
</p>
<p>
"Truly, mademoiselle," said he, "you are right; and I have good cause to
be displeased and angry. Moreover, it is owing to you that I am in this
condition."
</p>
<p>
"To me?" said she. "Alas, I have done nothing that I am aware of, for
you are the only man in the world to whom I would give pleasure, and
whose grief and displeasure touch my heart."
</p>
<p>
"The man who refuses to believe that will not be damned," said he. "Do
you think that I have not perceived that you are on good terms with
so-and-so (that is to say the first-comer). It is so, by my oath, and
I have but too often seen him speak to you apart, and, what is more, I
have watched and seen him enter here. But by heaven, if ever I find him
here his last day has come, whatever may happen to me in consequence. I
could not allow him to be aware that he has done me this injury&mdash;I would
rather die a thousand times if it were possible. And you are as false as
he is for you know of a truth that after God I love no one but you, and
yet you encourage him, and so do me great wrong!"
</p>
<p>
"Ah, monseigneur!" she replied, "who has told you this story? By my
soul! I wish that God and you should know that it is quite otherwise,
and I call Him to witness that never in my life have I given an
assignation to him of whom you speak, nor to any other whoever he may
be&mdash;so you have little enough cause to be displeased with me. I will not
deny that I have spoken to him, and speak to him every day, and also to
many others, but I have never had aught to do with him, nor do I believe
that he thinks of me even for a moment, or if so, by God he is mistaken.
May God not suffer me to live if any but you has part or parcel in what
is yours entirely."
</p>
<p>
"Mademoiselle," said he, "you talk very well, but I am not such a fool
as to believe you."
</p>
<p>
Angry and displeased as he was, he nevertheless did that for which he
came, and on leaving, said,
</p>
<p>
"I have told you, and given you fair warning that if ever I find any
other person comes here, I will put him, or cause him to be put, in such
a condition that he will never again worry me or any one else."
</p>
<p>
"Ah, Monseigneur," she replied, "by God you are wrong to imagine such
things about him, and I am sure also that he does not think of me."
</p>
<p>
With that, the last-comer left, and, on the morrow, his friend, the
first-comer did not fail to come early in the morning to hear the news,
and the other related to him in full all that had passed, how he had
pretended to be angry and threatened to kill his rival, and the replies
the jade made.
</p>
<p>
"By my oath," said the first, "she acted the comedy well! Now let me
have my turn, and I shall be very much surprised if I do not play my
part equally well."
</p>
<p>
A certain time afterwards his turn came, and he went to the wench, who
received him as lovingly as she always did, and as she had previously
received her other lover. If his friend the last-comer had been cross
and quarrelsome both in manner and words, he was still more so, and
spoke to her in this manner;
</p>
<p>
"I curse the hour and the day on which I made your acquaintance, for
it is not possible to load the heart of a poor lover with more sorrows,
regrets, and bitter cares than oppress and weigh down my heart to-day.
Alas! I chose you amongst all others as the perfection of beauty,
gentleness, and kindness, and hoped that I should find in you truth and
fidelity, and therefore I gave you all my heart, believing in truth that
it was safe in your keeping, and I had such faith in you that I would
have met death, or worse, had it been possible, to save your honour.
Yet, when I thought myself most sure of your faith, I learned, not only
by the report of others but by my own eyes, that another had snatched
your love from me, and deprived me of the hope of being the one person
in the world who was dearest to you."
</p>
<p>
"My friend," said the wench, "I do not know what your trouble is, but
from your manner and your words I judge that there is something
the matter, but I cannot tell what it is if you do not speak more
plainly&mdash;unless it be a little jealousy which torments you, and if so, I
think, if you are wise, that you will soon banish it from your mind. For
I have never given you any cause for that, as you know me well enough
to be aware, and you should be sorry for having used such expressions to
me."
</p>
<p>
"I am not the sort of man," said he, "to be satisfied with mere words.
Your excuses are worth nothing. You cannot deny that so-and-so (that
is to say the last-comer) does not keep you. I know well he does, for I
have noticed you, and moreover, have watched, and saw him yesterday come
to you at such an hour, dressed in such and such a manner. But I swear
to God he has had his last pleasure with you, for I bear him a grudge,
and were he ten times as great a man as he is, when I meet him I will
deprive him of his life, or he shall deprive me of mine; one of us two
must die for I cannot live and see another enjoy you. You are false and
disloyal to have deceived me, and it is not without cause that I curse
the hour I made your acquaintance, for I know for a certainty that you
will cause my death if my rival knows my determination, as I hope he
will. I know that I am now as good as dead, and even if he should spare
me, he does but sharpen the knife which is to shorten his own days, and
then the world would not be big enough to save me, and die I must."
</p>
<p>
The wench could not readily find a sufficient excuse to satisfy him in
his present state of mind. Nevertheless, she did her best to dissipate
his melancholy, and drive away his suspicions, and said to him;
</p>
<p>
"My friend, I have heard your long tirade, which, to tell the truth,
makes me reflect that I have not been so prudent as I ought, and have
too readily believed your deceitful speeches, and obeyed you in all
things, which is the reason you now think so little of me. Another
reason why you speak to me thus, is that you know that I am so much in
love with you that I cannot bear to live out of your presence. And for
this cause, and many others that I need not mention, you deem me your
subject and slave, with no right to speak or look at any but you. Since
that pleases you, I am satisfied, but you have no right to suspect me
with regard to any living person, nor have I any need to excuse myself.
Truth, which conquers all things, will right me in the end!"
</p>
<p>
"By God, my dear," said the young man, "the truth is what I have already
told you&mdash;as both and he will find to your cost if you do not take
care."
</p>
<p>
After these speeches, and others too long to recount here, he left, and
did not forget on the following morning to recount everything to his
friend the last-comer; and God knows what laughter and jests they had
between them.
</p>
<p>
The wench, who still had wool on her distaff (*), saw and knew very well
that each of her lovers suspected the other, nevertheless she continued
to receive them each in his turn, without sending either away. She
warned each earnestly that he must come to her in the most secret
manner, in order that he should not be perceived.
</p>
<pre>
     (*) i.e. plenty of tricks or resources.
</pre>
<p>
You must know that when the first-comer had his turn that he did not
forget to complain as before, and threatened to kill his rival should he
meet him. Also at his last meeting, he pretended to be more angry than
he really was, and made very light of his rival, who, according to him,
was as good as dead if he were caught with her. But the cunning and
double-dealing jade had so many deceitful speeches ready that her
excuses sounded as true as the Gospel. For she believed that, whatever
doubts and suspicions they had, the affair would never really be found
out, and that she was capable of satisfying them both.
</p>
<p>
It was otherwise in the end, for the last-comer, whom she was greatly
afraid to lose, one day read her a sharp lesson. In fact he told
her that he would never see her again, and did not for a long time
afterwards, at which she was much displeased and dissatisfied.
</p>
<p>
And in order to embarrass and annoy her still more, he sent to her a
gentleman, a confidential friend, to point out how disgusted he was to
find he had a rival, and to tell her, in short, that if she did not send
away this rival, that he would never see her again as long as he lived.
</p>
<p>
As you have already heard, she would not willingly give up his
acquaintance, and there was no male or female saint by whom she did
not perjure herself in explaining away her love passages with her other
lover, and at last, quite beside herself, she said to the squire;
</p>
<p>
"I will show your master that I love him; give me your knife."
</p>
<p>
Then, when she had the knife, she took off her headdress, and with the
knife cut off all her hair&mdash;not very evenly.
</p>
<p>
The squire, who knew the facts of the case, took this present, and said
he would do his duty and give it to his master, which he soon did. The
last-comer received the parcel, which he undid, and found the hair of
his mistress, which was very long and beautiful. He did not feel much at
ease until he had sent for his friend and revealed to him the message he
had sent, and the valuable present she had given him in return, and then
he showed the beautiful long tresses.
</p>
<p>
"I fancy," said he, "I must be very high in her good graces. You can
scarcely expect that she would do as much for you."
</p>
<p>
"By St. John!" said the other, "this is strange news. I see plainly that
I am left out in the cold. It is finished! You are the favoured one. But
let us" he added, "think what is to be done. We must show her plainly
that we know what she is."
</p>
<p>
"That's what I wish," said the other.
</p>
<p>
They thought the matter over, and arranged their plan as follows.
</p>
<p>
The next day, or soon afterwards, the two friends were in a chamber
where there were assembled their fair lady and many others. Each took
his place where he liked; the first-comer sat near the damsel, and after
some talk, he showed her the hair which she had sent to his friend.
</p>
<p>
Whatever she may have thought, she was not startled, but said she did
not know whose hair it was, but it did not belong to her.
</p>
<p>
"What?" he said. "Has it so quickly changed that it cannot be
recognised?"
</p>
<p>
"That I cannot say," she replied, "but it does not belong to me."
</p>
<p>
When he heard that, he thought it was time to play his best card, and,
as though by accident, gave her <i>chaperon</i> (*) such a twitch that it
fell to the ground, at which she was both angry and ashamed. And all
those who were present saw that her hair was short, and had been badly
hacked.
</p>
<pre>
     (*) The chaperon, in the time of Charles VII, was fastened
     to the shoulder by a long band which sometimes passed two or
     three times round the neck, and sometimes hung down the
     back.
</pre>
<p>
She rose in haste, and snatched up her head-dress, and ran into another
chamber to attire herself, and he followed her. He found her angry and
ashamed, and weeping bitterly with vexation at being thus caught. He
asked her what she had to weep about, and at what game she had lost her
hair?
</p>
<p>
She did not know what to reply, she was so vexed and astonished; and he,
who was determined to carry out the arrangement he had concluded with
his friend, said to her;
</p>
<p>
"False and disloyal as you are, you have not cared that I and my
friend were deceived and dishonoured. You wished,&mdash;as you have plainly
shown&mdash;to add two more victims to your list, but, thank God, we were on
our guard. And, in order that you may see that we both know you, here is
your hair which you sent him, and which he has presented to me; and do
not believe that we are such fools as you have hitherto thought us."
</p>
<p>
Then he called his friend, who came, and the first said,
</p>
<p>
"I have given back this fair damsel her hair, an have begun to tell her
how she has accepted the love of both of us, and how by her manner of
acting she has shown us that she did not care whether she disgraced us
both&mdash;may God save us!"
</p>
<p>
"Truly&mdash;by St. John!" said the other, and thereupon he made a long
speech to the wench, and God knows he talked to her well, remonstrating
with her on her cowardice and disloyal heart. Never was woman so well
lectured as she was at that time, first by one then by the other.
</p>
<p>
She was so taken by surprise that she did not know what to reply, except
by tears, which she shed abundantly.
</p>
<p>
She had never had enough pleasure out of both her lovers to compensate
for the vexation she suffered at that moment.
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, in the end they did not desert her, but lived as they did
before, each taking his turn, and if by chance they both came to her
together, the one gave place to the other, and they were both good
friends as before, without ever talking of killing or fighting.
</p>
<p>
For a long time the two friends continued this pleasant manner of
loving, and the poor wench never dared to refuse either of them. And
whenever the one wished to have intercourse with her, he told the other,
and whenever the second went to see her, the first stayed at home. They
made each other many compliments, and sent one another rondels and
songs which are now celebrated, about the circumstances I have already
related, and of which I now conclude the account.

<h2>
    STORY THE THIRTY-FOURTH &mdash; THE MAN ABOVE AND THE MAN BELOW. <a href="#note-34" name="noteref-34">34</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monsigneur De La Roche.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a married woman who gave rendezvous to two lovers, who came and
visited her, and her husband came soon after, and of the words which
passed between them, as you shall presently hear.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
I knew in my time a brave and worthy woman, deserving to be remembered
and respected, for her virtues should not be hidden and kept dark, but
publicly blazoned to the world. You will shortly hear, if you will, in
this story something which will increase and magnify her fame.
</p>
<p>
This gallant wench was married to a countryman of ours, and had many
lovers seeking and desiring her favours,&mdash;which were not over difficult
to obtain, for she was so kind and compassionate that she both would and
could bestow herself freely whenever she liked.
</p>
<p>
It happened one day that two men came to see her, as both were
accustomed, to ask for a rendezvous. She would not have retreated before
two or even three, and appointed a day and hour for each to come to
her&mdash;the one at eight o'clock the morrow morning, and the other at
nine, and charged each one expressly that he should not fail to keep his
appointed hour.
</p>
<p>
They promised on their faith and honour that if they were alive they
would keep their assignation.
</p>
<p>
When the morrow came, at about 6 o'clock in the morning, the husband
of this brave wench rose, dressed himself, and called his wife, but she
bluntly refused to get up when ordered.
</p>
<p>
"Faith!" she said, "I have such a headache that I cannot stand on my
feet, or if I did get up I should die, I am so weak and worn-out; and,
as you know, I did not sleep all the night. I beg of you to leave me
here, and I hope that when I am alone I shall get a little rest."
</p>
<p>
Her husband, though he suspected something, did not dare to contradict
her or reply, but went about his business in the town, whilst his wife
was not idle at home, for eight o'clock had no sooner struck than the
honest fellow, to whom on the previous day an assignation had been
given, came and knocked at the door, and she let him in. He soon took
off his long gown and his other clothes, and joined madame in bed, in
order to cheer her up.
</p>
<p>
Whilst these two were locked in each other's arms, and otherwise
engaged, the time passed quickly without her noticing it, when she heard
some one knock loudly at the door.
</p>
<p>
"Ah!" she said, "as I live, there is my husband; make haste and take
your clothes."
</p>
<p>
"Your husband?" he said, "Why, do you know his knock?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," she replied, "I know it very well. Make haste lest he find you
here."
</p>
<p>
"If it be your husband, he must find me here, for I know not where I can
hide."
</p>
<p>
"No, please God, he must not find you here, for you would be killed and
so should I, he is so terrible. Get up into this little attic, and keep
quite quiet and do not move, that he may not find you here."
</p>
<p>
The other climbed into the garret as he was told, and found the planks
stripped away in many places, and the laths broken.
</p>
<p>
As soon as he was safe, mademoiselle made one bound to the door, knowing
very well that it was not her husband who was there, and let in the
man who had promised to come to her at nine o'clock. They came into
the chamber, where they were not long on their feet, but laid down and
cuddled and kissed in the same manner as he in the garret had done,
whilst he, through a chink, kept his eye on the couple, and was not best
pleased. He could not make up his mind whether he should speak or hold
his tongue. At last he determined to keep silence, and not say a word
till the opportunity came,&mdash;and you may guess that he had plenty of
patience.
</p>
<p>
Whilst he was waiting and looking at the lady engaged with the last
comer, the worthy husband came home to enquire after the health of his
good wife, as it was very proper of him to do.
</p>
<p>
She soon heard him, and as quickly as may be, made her lover get out of
bed, and as she did not know where to hide him, since she could not put
him in the garret, she made him lie down between the bed and the wall,
and covered him with his clothes, and said to him.
</p>
<p>
"I have no better place to put you&mdash;have a little patience."
</p>
<p>
She had hardly finished speaking when her husband came into the room,
and though he had heard nothing, he found the bed all rumpled and tossed
about, the quilt dirty and soiled, and looking more like the bed of a
bride than the couch of an invalid.
</p>
<p>
The doubts he had formerly entertained, combined with the appearance of
the bed, made him call his wife by her name, and say.
</p>
<p>
"Wicked whore that you are! I did not believe you when you shammed
illness this morning! Where is the whoremonger? I swear to God, if I
find him, he will have a bad end, and you too." Then, putting his hand
on the quilt, he went on. "This looks nice, doesn't it? It looks as
though the pigs had slept on it!"
</p>
<p>
"What is the matter with you, you nasty drunkard?" she replied. "Why
make me suffer when you get too much wine in your belly? That's a nice
salutation, to call me a whore! I would have you to know that I am
nothing of the kind, but much too virtuous and too honest for a rascal
like you, and my only regret is that I have been so good to you, for
you are not worth it. I do not know why I do not get up and scratch
your face in such a manner that you would remember it all your life, for
having abused me without cause."
</p>
<p>
If you ask how she dared reply to her husband in this manner, I should
answer there were two reasons,&mdash;that is she had both right and might on
her side. For, as you may guess, if it had come to blows, both the
lover in the garret, and the one by the bed, would have come to her
assistance.
</p>
<p>
The poor husband did not know what to say when he heard his wife abuse
him thus, and as he saw that big words were of no use, he left the
matter to God, who does justice to all, and replied;
</p>
<p>
"You make many excuses for your palpable faults, but I care little what
you say. I am not going to quarrel and make a noise; there is One above
who will repay all!"
</p>
<p>
By "One above", he meant God,&mdash;as though he had said,
</p>
<p>
"God, who gives everyone his due, will repay you according to your
deserts." But the gallant who was in the garret, and heard these words,
really believed they were meant for him, and that he was expected to pay
for the misdeeds of another besides himself, and he replied aloud;
</p>
<p>
"What? Surely it will suffice if I pay half! The man who is down by the
side of the bed can pay the other half&mdash;he is as much concerned as I
am!"
</p>
<p>
You may guess that the husband was much astonished, for he thought that
God was speaking to him; and the man by the bed did not know what to
think, for he knew nothing about the existence of the other man. He
quickly jumped up, and the other man came down, and they recognised each
other.
</p>
<p>
They went off together, and left the couple looking vexed and angry, but
they did not trouble much about that and for good reason.

<h2>
    STORY THE THIRTY-FIFTH &mdash; THE EXCHANGE.
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur De Villiers.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a knight whose mistress married whilst he was on his travels, and on
his return, by chance he came to her house, and she, in order that she
might sleep with him, caused a young damsel, her chamber-maid, to go to
bed with her husband; and of the words that passed between the husband
and the knight his guest, as are more fully recorded hereafter.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A gentleman, a knight of this kingdom, a most virtuous man, and of great
renown, a great traveller and a celebrated warrior, fell in love with a
very beautiful damsel, and so advanced in her good graces that nothing
that he demanded was refused him. It happened, I know not how long after
that, this good knight, to acquire honour and merit, left his castle,
in good health and well accompanied, by the permission of his master, to
bear arms elsewhere, and he went to Spain and various places, where he
did such feats that he was received in great triumph at his return.
</p>
<p>
During this time the lady married an old knight who was courteous and
wise, and who in his time had been a courtier, and&mdash;to say truth&mdash;was
known as the very mirror of honour. It was a matter for regret that he
did not marry better, but at any rate he had not then discovered his
wife's misconduct, as he did afterwards, as you shall hear.
</p>
<p>
The first-named knight, returning from the war, as he was travelling
through the country, arrived by chance one night at the castle where his
mistress lived, and God knows what good cheer she and her husband made
for him, for there had been a great friendship between them.
</p>
<p>
But you must know that whilst the master of the house was doing all
he could to honour his guest, the guest was conversing with his former
lady-love, and was willing to renew with her the intimacy that had
existed before she married. She asked for nothing better, but excused
herself on account of want of opportunity.
</p>
<p>
"It is not possible to find a chance."
</p>
<p>
"Ah, madam," he said, "by my oath, if you want to, you will make a
chance. When your husband is in bed and asleep, you can come to my
chamber, or, if you prefer it, I will come to you."
</p>
<p>
"It cannot be managed so," she replied; "the danger is too great; for
monseigneur is a very light sleeper, and he never wakes but what he
feels for me, and if he did not find me, you may guess what it would
be."
</p>
<p>
"And when he does find you," he said, "what does he do to you?"
</p>
<p>
"Nothing else," she replied; "he turns over on the other side."
</p>
<p>
"Faith!" said he, "he is a very bad bed-fellow; it is very lucky for you
that I came to your aid to perform for you what he cannot."
</p>
<p>
"So help me God," she said, "when he lies with me once a month it is the
best he can do. I may be difficult to please, but I could take a good
deal more than that.
</p>
<p>
"That is not to be wondered at," he said; "but let us consider what we
shall do."
</p>
<p>
"There is no way that I see," she replied, "that it can be managed."
</p>
<p>
"What?" he said; "have you no woman in the house to whom you can explain
the difficulty?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, by God! I have one," she said, "in whom I have such confidence
that I would tell her anything in the world I wanted kept secret?
without fearing that she would ever repeat it."
</p>
<p>
"What more do we want then?" he said. "The rest concerns you and her."
</p>
<p>
The lady who was anxious to be with her lover, called the damsel, and
said,
</p>
<p>
"My dear, you must help me to-night to do something which is very dear
to my heart."
</p>
<p>
"Madam," said the damsel, "I am ready and glad, as I ought to be, to
serve you and obey you in any way possible; command me, and I will
perform your orders."
</p>
<p>
"I thank you, my dear," said madam, "and be sure that you will lose
nothing by it. This is what is the matter. The knight here is the man
whom I love best in all the world, and I would not that he left here
without my having a few words with him. Now he cannot tell me what is
in his heart unless we be alone together, and you are the only person to
take my place by the side of monseigneur. He is accustomed, as you know,
to turn in the night and touch me, and then he leaves me and goes to
sleep again."
</p>
<p>
"I will do your pleasure, madam; there is nothing that you can command
that I will not do."
</p>
<p>
"Well, my dear," she said, "you will go to bed as I do, keeping a good
way off from monseigneur, and take care that if he should speak to you
not to reply, and suffer him to do whatever he may like."
</p>
<p>
"I will do your pleasure, madam."
</p>
<p>
Supper-time came. There is no need to describe the meal, suffice it to
say there was good cheer and plenty of it, and after supper, sports, and
the visitor took madam's arm, and the other gentlemen escorted the other
damsels. The host came last, and enquired about the knight's travels
from an old gentleman who had accompanied him.
</p>
<p>
Madame did not forget to tell her lover that one of her women would take
her place that night, and that she would come to him; at which he was
very joyful, and thanked her much, and wished that the hour had come.
</p>
<p>
They returned to the reception hall, where monseigneur said good
night to his guest, and his wife did the same. The visitor went to
his chamber, which was large and well-furnished, and there was a fine
sideboard laden with spices and preserves, and good wine of many sorts.
</p>
<p>
He soon undressed, and drank a cup, and made his attendants drink also,
and then sent them to bed, and remained alone, waiting for the lady, who
was with her husband. Both she and her husband undressed and got into
bed.
</p>
<p>
The damsel was in the <i>ruelle</i>, and as soon as my lord was in bed, she
took the place of her mistress, who&mdash;as her heart desired&mdash;made but one
bound to the chamber of the lover, who was anxiously awaiting her.
</p>
<p>
Thus were they all lodged&mdash;monseigneur with the chambermaid, and his
guest with madame&mdash;and you may guess that these two did not pass all the
night in sleeping.
</p>
<p>
Monseigneur, as was his wont, awoke an hour before day-break, and turned
to the chamber-maid, believing it to be his wife, and to feel her he put
out his hand, which by chance encountered one of her breasts, which were
large and firm, and he knew at once that it was not his wife, for she
was not well furnished in that respect.
</p>
<p>
"Ha, ha!" he said to himself, "I understand what it is! They are playing
me a trick, and I will play them another."
</p>
<p>
He turned towards the girl, and with some trouble managed to break a
lance, but she let him do it without uttering a word or half a word.
</p>
<p>
When he had finished, he began to call as loudly as he could to the man
who was sleeping with his wife.
</p>
<p>
"Hallo! my lord of such a place! Where are you? Speak to me!"
</p>
<p>
The other, when he heard himself called, was much astonished, and the
lady quite overwhelmed with shame.
</p>
<p>
"Alas!" she said, "our deeds are discovered: I am a lost woman!"
</p>
<p>
Her husband called out,
</p>
<p>
"Hallo, monseigneur! hallo, my guest! Speak to me."
</p>
<p>
The other ventured to speak, and said,
</p>
<p>
"What is it, so please you, monsiegneur?"
</p>
<p>
"I will make this exchange with you whenever you like."
</p>
<p>
"What exchange?" he asked.
</p>
<p>
"An old, worn-out false, treacherous woman, for a good, pretty, and
fresh young girl. That is what I have gained by the exchange and I thank
you for it."
</p>
<p>
None of the others knew what to reply, even the poor chamber-maid wished
she were dead, both on account of the dishonour to her mistress and the
unfortunate loss of her own virginity.
</p>
<p>
The visitor left the lady and the castle as soon as could, without
thanking his host, or saying farewell. And never again did he go there,
so he never knew how she settled the matter with her husband afterwards,
so I can tell you no more.

<h2>
    STORY THE THIRTY-SIXTH &mdash; AT WORK.
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur De La Roche.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a squire who saw his mistress, whom he greatly loved, between
two other gentlemern, and did not notice that she had hold of both of
them till another knight informed him of the matter as you will hear.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A kind and noble gentleman, who wished to spend his time in the service
of the Court of Love, devoted himself, heart, body, and goods, to a fair
and honest damsel who well deserved it, and who was specially suited to
do what she liked with men; and his amour with her lasted long. And he
thought that he stood high in her good graces, though to say the truth,
he was no more a favourite than the others, of whom there were many.
</p>
<p>
It happened one day that this worthy gentleman found his lady, by
chance, in the embrasure of a window, between a knight and a squire, to
whom she was talking. Sometimes she would speak to one apart and not let
the other hear, another time she did the same to the other, to please
both of them, but the poor lover was greatly vexed and jealous, and did
not dare to approach the group.
</p>
<p>
The only thing to do was to walk away from her, although he desired her
presence more than anything else in the world. His heart told him that
this conversation would not tend to his advantage, in which he was not
far wrong. For, if his eyes had not been blinded by affection, he could
easily have seen what another, who was not concerned, quickly perceived,
and showed him, in this wise.
</p>
<p>
When he saw and knew for certain that the lady had neither leisure nor
inclination to talk to him, he retired to a couch and lay down, but he
could not sleep.
</p>
<p>
Whilst he was thus sulking, there came a gentleman, who saluted all the
company, and seeing that the damsel was engaged, withdrew to the recess
where the squire was lying sleepless upon the couch; and amongst other
conversation the squire said,
</p>
<p>
"By my faith, monseigneur, look towards the window; there are some
people who are making themselves comfortable. Do you not see how
pleasantly they are talking."
</p>
<p>
"By St. John, I see them," said the knight, "and see that they are doing
something more than talking."
</p>
<p>
"What else?" said the other.
</p>
<p>
"What else? Do you not see that she has got hold of both of them?"
</p>
<p>
"Got hold of them!"
</p>
<p>
"Truly yes, poor fellow! Where are your eyes? But there is a great
difference between the two, for the one she holds in her left hand is
neither so big nor so long as that which she holds in her right hand."
</p>
<p>
"Ha!" said the squire, "you say right. May St. Anthony burn the wanton;"
and you may guess that he was not well pleased.
</p>
<p>
"Take no heed," said the knight, "and bear your wrong as patiently
as you can. It is not here that you have to show your courage: make a
virtue of necessity."
</p>
<p>
Having thus spoken, the worthy knight approached the window where the
three were standing, and noticed by chance that the knight on the left,
hand, was standing on tip-toe, attending to what the fair damsel and the
squire were saying and doing.
</p>
<p>
Giving him a slight tap on his hat, the knight said,
</p>
<p>
"Mind your own business in the devil's name, and don't trouble about
other people."
</p>
<p>
The other withdrew, and began to laugh, but the damsel, who was not the
sort of woman to care about trifles, scarcely showed any concern, but
quietly let go her hold without brushing or changing colour, though she
was sorry in her heart to let out of her hand what she could have well
used in another place.
</p>
<p>
As you may guess, both before and after that time, either of those two
would most willingly have done her a service, and the poor, sick lover
was obliged to be a witness of the greatest misfortune which could
happen to him, and his poor heart would have driven him to despair,
if reason had not come to his help, and caused him to abandon his love
affairs, out of which he had never derived any benefit.

<h2>
    STORY THE THIRTY-SEVENTH &mdash; THE USE OF DIRTY WATER.
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur De La Roche.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a jealous man who recorded all the tricks which he could hear or
learn by which wives had deceived their husbands in old times; but at
last he was deceived by means of dirty water which the lover of the said
lady threw out of window upon her as she was going to Mass, as you shall
hear hereafter.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Whilst others are thinking and ransacking their memories for adventures
and deeds fit to be narrated and added to the present history, I will
relate to you, briefly, how the most jealous man in this kingdom, in his
time, was deceived. I do not suppose that he was the only one who ever
suffered this misfortune, but at any rate I will not omit to describe
the clever trick that was played upon him.
</p>
<p>
This jealous old hunks was a great historian, and had often read and
re-read all sorts of stories; but the principal end and aim of all his
study was to learn and know all the ways and manners in which wives had
deceived their husbands. For&mdash;thank God&mdash;old histories like Matheolus
(*), Juvenal, the Fifteen Joys of Marriage (**), and more others than I
can count, abound in descriptions of deceits, tricks, and deceptions of
that sort.
</p>
<pre>
     (*) <i>Le Lime</i>, de Matheolus, a poem of the early part of the
     15th Century, written by Jean le Febvre, Bishop of
     Therouenne. It is a violent satire against women.

     (**) A curious old work the authorship of which is still
     doubtful. It is often ascribed to Antoine de la Sale, who is
     believed to have partly written and edited the <i>Cent
     Nouvelles Nouvelles</i>. The allusion is interesting as showing
     that the Quinze Joyes de mariage was written before the
     present work.
</pre>
<p>
Our jealous husband had always one or other of these books in his hand,
and was as fond of them as a fool is of his bauble,&mdash;reading or studying
them; and indeed he had made from these books a compendium for his own
use, in which all the tricks and deceits practised by wives on their
husbands were noted and described.
</p>
<p>
This he had done in order to be forewarned and on his guard, should
his wife perchance use any of the plans or subterfuges chronicled or
registered in his book. For he watched his wife as carefully as the most
jealous Italian would, and still was not content, so ruled was he by
this cursed passion of jealousy.
</p>
<p>
In this delectable state did the poor man live three or four years with
his wife, and the only amusement she had in that time was to escape
out of his hateful presence by going to Mass, and then she was always
accompanied by an old servant, who was charged to watch over her.
</p>
<p>
A gentle knight, who had heard how the fair lady was watched, one day
met the damsel, who was both beautiful and witty, and told her how
willing he was to do her a service, that he sighed for her love, and
condoled with her evil fortune in being allied to the most jealous
wretch there was on the face of the earth, and saying, moreover, that
she was the sole person on earth for whom he cared.
</p>
<p>
"And since I cannot tell you here how much I love you, and many other
things which I hope you will be glad to hear, I will, if you wish, put
it all in writing and give it you to-morrow, begging also that any small
service that I most willingly do for you, be not refused."
</p>
<p>
She gladly listened, but owing to the presence of Dangier, (*) who was
near, hardly replied; nevertheless she said she would be glad to have
his letter when it came.
</p>
<pre>
      (*) See note page 159.
</pre>
<p>
Her lover was very joyful when he took leave of her, and with good
cause, and the damsel said farewell to him in a kind and gracious
manner, but the old woman, who watched her, did not fail to ask her what
conversation had taken place between her and the man who had just left.
</p>
<p>
"He brought me news of my mother," she replied; "at which I am very
joyful, for she is in good health."
</p>
<p>
The old woman asked no more, and they returned home.
</p>
<p>
On the morrow, the lover, provided with a letter written God knows
in what terms, met the lady, and gave her this letter so quickly and
cunningly that the old servant, who was watching, saw nothing.
</p>
<p>
The letter was opened by her most joyfully when she was alone. The gist
of the contents was that he had fallen in love with her, and that he
knew not a day's happiness when he was absent from her, and finally
hoped that she would of her kindness appoint a suitable place where she
could give him a reply to this letter.
</p>
<p>
She wrote a reply in which she said she could love no one but her
husband, to whom she owed all faith and loyalty; nevertheless, she was
pleased to know the writer was so much in love with her, but, though she
could promise him no reward, would be glad to hear what he had to say,
but certainly that could not be, because her husband never left her
except when she went to church, and then she was guarded, and more than
guarded, by the dirtiest old hag that ever interfered with anybody.
</p>
<p>
The lover, dressed quite differently to what he had been the preceding
day, met the lady, who knew him at once, and as he passed close to her,
received from her hand the letter already mentioned. That he was anxious
to know the contents was no marvel. He went round a corner, and there,
at his leisure, learned the condition of affairs, which seemed to be
progressing favourably.
</p>
<p>
It needed but time and place to carry out his enterprise, and he thought
night and day how this was to be accomplished. At last he thought of
a first-rate trick, for he remembered that a lady friend of his lived
between the church where his lady went to Mass and her house, and he
told her the history of his love affair, concealing nothing from her,
and begging her to help him.
</p>
<p>
"Whatever I can do for you, I will do with all my heart," she said.
</p>
<p>
"I thank you," said he. "Would you mind if I met her here?"
</p>
<p>
"Faith!" she said, "to please you, I do not mind!"
</p>
<p>
"Well!" he replied, "if ever it is in my power to do you a service, you
may be sure that I will remember this kindness."
</p>
<p>
He was not satisfied till he had written again to his lady-love and
given her the letter, in which he said that he had made an arrangement
with a certain woman, "who is a great friend of mine, a respectable
woman, who can loyally keep a secret, and who knows you well and loves
you, and who will lend us her house where we may meet. And this is the
plan I have devised. I will be to-morrow in an upper chamber which looks
on the street, and I will have by me a large pitcher of water mingled
with ashes, which I will upset on you suddenly as you pass. And I shall
be so disguised that neither your old woman, nor anyone else in the
world, will recognise me. When you have been drenched with this water,
you will pretend to be very angry and surprised, and take refuge in the
house, and send your Dangier to seek another gown; and while she is on
the road we will talk together."
</p>
<p>
To shorten the story, the letter was given, and the lady, who was very
well pleased, sent a reply.
</p>
<p>
The next day came, and the lady was drenched by her lover with a pitcher
of water and cinders, in such fashion that her kerchief, gown, and other
habiliments were all spoiled and ruined. God knows that she was very
astonished and displeased, and rushed into the house, as though she were
beside herself, and ignorant of where she was.
</p>
<p>
When she saw the lady of the house, she complained bitterly of the
mischief which had been done, and I cannot tell you how much she grieved
over this misadventure. Now she grieved for her kerchief, now for her
gown, and another time for her other clothes,&mdash;in short, if anyone had
heard her, they would have thought the world was coming to an end.
</p>
<p>
The old woman, who was also in a great rage, had a knife in her hand,
with which she scraped the gown as well as she could.
</p>
<p>
"No, no, my friend! you only waste your time. It cannot be cleaned as
easily as that: you cannot do any good. I must have another gown and
another kerchief-there is nothing else to be done. Go home and fetch
them, and make haste and come back, or we shall lose the Mass in
addition to our other troubles."
</p>
<p>
The old woman seeing that there was imperative need of the clothes, did
not dare to refuse her mistress, and took the gown and kerchief under
her mantle, and went home.
</p>
<p>
She had scarcely turned on her heels, before her mistress was conducted
to the chamber where her lover was, who was pleased to see her in a
simple petticoat and with her hair down.
</p>
<p>
Whilst they are talking together, let us return to the old woman, who
went back to the house, where she found her master, who did not wait for
her to speak, but asked her at once,
</p>
<p>
"What have you done with my wife? where is she?"
</p>
<p>
"I have left her," she replied, "at such a person's house, in such a
place."
</p>
<p>
"And for what purpose?" said he.
</p>
<p>
Then she showed him the gown and the kerchief, and told him about the
pitcher of water and ashes, and said that she had been sent to seek
other clothes, for her mistress could not leave the place where she was
in that state.
</p>
<p>
"Is that so?" said he. "By Our Lady! that trick is not in my book! Go!
Go! I know well what has happened."
</p>
<p>
He would have added that he was cuckolded, and I believe he was at that
time, and he never again kept a record of the various tricks that had
been played on husbands. Moreover, it is believed that he never forgot
the trick which had been played on him. There was no need for him to
write it down&mdash;he preserved a lively memory of it the few good days that
he had to live.

<h2>
    STORY THE THIRTY-EIGHTH &mdash; A ROD FOR ANOTHER'S BACK. <a href="#note-38" name="noteref-38">38</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By The Seneschal Of Guyenne.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a citizen of Tours who bought a lamprey which he sent to his wife
to cook in order that he might give a feast to the priest, and the said
wife sent it to a Cordelier, who was her lover, and how she made a woman
who was her neighbour sleep with her husband, and how the woman was
beaten, and what the wife made her husband believe, as you will hear
hereafter.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
There was formerly a merchant of Tours, who, to give a feast to his
curé and other worthy people, bought a large lamprey, and sent it to his
house, and charged his wife to cook it, as she well knew how to do.
</p>
<p>
"And see," said he, "that the dinner is ready at twelve o'clock, for I
shall bring our curé, and some other people" (whom he named).
</p>
<p>
"All shall be ready," she replied, "bring whom you will."
</p>
<p>
She prepared a lot of nice fish, and when she saw the lamprey she wished
that her paramour, a Cordelier, could have it, and said to herself,
</p>
<p>
"Ah, Brother Bernard, why are you not here? By my oath, you should not
leave till you had tasted this lamprey, or, if you liked, you should
take it to your own room, and I would not fail to keep you company."
</p>
<p>
It was with great regret that the good woman began to prepare the
lamprey for her husband, for she was thinking how the Cordelier could
have it. She thought so much about it that she finally determined to
send the lamprey by an old woman, who knew her secret. She did so, and
told the Cordelier that she would come at night, and sup and sleep with
him.
</p>
<p>
When the Cordelier heard that she was coming, you may guess that he was
joyful and contented, and he told the old woman that he would get some
good wine to do honour to the lamprey. The old woman returned, and
delivered his message.
</p>
<p>
About twelve o'clock came our merchant, the curé, and the other guests,
to eat this lamprey, which had now gone far out of their reach. When
they were all in the merchant's house, he took them all into the kitchen
to show them the big lamprey that he was going to give them, and called
his wife, and said,
</p>
<p>
"Show us our lamprey, I want to tell our guests how cheap I bought it."
</p>
<p>
"What lamprey?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"The lamprey that I gave you for our dinner, along with the other fish."
</p>
<p>
"I have seen no lamprey," she said; "I think you must be dreaming. Here
are a carp, two pike, and I know not what fish beside, but I have seen
no lamprey to day."
</p>
<p>
"What?" said he. "Do you think I am drunk?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," replied the curé and the other guests, "we think no less. You are
too niggardly to buy such a lamprey."
</p>
<p>
"By God," said his wife, "he is either making fun of you or he is
dreaming&mdash;for certainly I have never seen this lamprey."
</p>
<p>
Her husband grew angry, and cried,
</p>
<p>
"You lie, you whore! Either you have eaten it, or you have hidden it
somewhere. I promise you it will be the dearest lamprey you ever had."
</p>
<p>
With that he turned to the curé and the others, and swore by God's death
and a hundred other oaths, that he had given his wife a lamprey which
had cost him a franc; but they, to tease him and torment him still more,
pretended not to believe him, and that they were very disappointed, and
said;
</p>
<p>
"We were invited to dinner at such houses, but we refused in order to
come here, thinking we were going to eat this lamprey; but, as far as we
can see, there is no chance of that."
</p>
<p>
Their host, who was in a terrible rage, picked up a stick, and advanced
towards his wife to thrash her, but the others held him back, and
dragged him by force out of the house, and with much trouble appeased
him as well as they could. Then, since they could not have the lamprey,
the curé had the table laid, and they made as good cheer as they could.
</p>
<p>
The good dame meanwhile sent for one of her neighbours, who was a widow,
but still good-looking and lively, and invited her to dinner; and when
she saw her opportunity, she said;
</p>
<p>
"My dear neighbour, it would be very kind of you to do me a great
service and pleasure, and if you will do this for me, I will repay you
in a manner that will please you."
</p>
<p>
"And what do you want me to do?" asked the other.
</p>
<p>
"I will tell you," said she. "My husband is so violent in his night-work
that it is astounding, and, in fact, last night he so tumbled me, that
by my oath I am afraid of him to-night. Therefore I would beg of you to
take my place, and if ever I can do anything for you in return, you may
command me&mdash;body and goods."
</p>
<p>
The good neighbour, to oblige her, promised to take her place&mdash;for which
she was greatly thanked.
</p>
<p>
Now you must know that our merchant when he returned from dinner, laid
in a good stock of birch rods, which he carried secretly into his house,
and hid near his bed, saying to himself that if his wife worried him she
should be well paid.
</p>
<p>
But he did not do this so secretly but what his wife was on her guard
and prepared, for she knew by long experience her husband's brutality.
</p>
<p>
He did not sup at home, but stopped out late, and came home when he
expected she would be in bed and naked. But his design failed, for late
that evening she made her neighbour undress and go to bed in her place,
and charged her expressly not to speak to her husband when he came, but
pretend to be dumb and ill. And she did more, for she put out the fire
both in the chamber and in the kitchen. That being done, she told her
neighbour that as soon as ever her husband rose in the morning, she was
to leave and return to her own house, and she promised that she would.
</p>
<p>
The neighbour being thus put to bed, the brave woman went off to the
Cordelier to eat the lamprey and gain her pardons, as was her custom.
</p>
<p>
While she was feasting there, the merchant came home after supper, full
of spite and anger about the lamprey, and to execute the plan he had
conceived, took his rods in his hand and then searched for a light for
the candle, but found no fire even in the chimney.
</p>
<p>
When he saw that, he went to bed without saying a word, and slept till
dawn, when he rose and dressed, and took his rods, and so thrashed his
wife's substitute, in revenge for the lamprey, till she bled all over,
and the sheets of the bed were as bloody as though a bullock had been
flayed on them, but the poor woman did not dare to say a word, or even
to show her face.
</p>
<p>
His rods being all broken, and his arm tired, he left the house, and the
poor woman, who had expected to enjoy the pleasant pastime of the
sports of love, went home soon afterwards to bemoan her ill-luck and
her wounds, and not without cursing and threatening the woman who had
brought this upon her.
</p>
<p>
Whilst the husband was still away from home, the good woman returned
from seeing the Cordelier, and found the bed-chamber all strewn with
birch twigs, the bed all crumpled, and the sheets covered with blood,
and she then knew that her neighbour had suffered bodily injury, as she
had expected. She at once remade the bed, and put on fresh and clean
sheets, and swept the chamber, and then she went to see her neighbour,
whom she found in a pitiable condition, and it need not be said was not
able to give her any consolation.
</p>
<p>
As soon as she could, she returned home, and undressed, and laid down
on the fair white bed that she had prepared, and slept well till her
husband returned from the town, his anger quite dissipated by the
revenge he had taken, and came to his wife whom he found in bed
pretending to sleep.
</p>
<p>
"What is the meaning of this, mademoiselle?" he said. "Is it not time
to get up?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh dear!" she said, "is it day yet? By my oath I never heard you get
up. I was having a dream which had lasted a long time."
</p>
<p>
"I expect," he replied, "that you were dreaming about the lamprey,
were you not? It would not be very wonderful if you did, for I gave you
something to remember it by this morning."
</p>
<p>
"By God!" she said, "I never thought about you or your lamprey."
</p>
<p>
"What?" said he. "Have you so soon forgotten?"
</p>
<p>
"Forgotten?" she answered. "Why not? a dream is soon forgotten."
</p>
<p>
"Well, then, did you dream about the bundle of birch rods I used on you
not two hours ago?"
</p>
<p>
"On me?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, certainly; on you," he said. "I know very well I thrashed you
soundly, as the sheets of the bed would show."
</p>
<p>
"By my oath, dear friend," she replied, "I do not know what you did
or dreamed, but for my part I recollect very well that this morning you
indulged in the sports of love with much desire; I am sure that if you
dreamed you did anything else to me it must be like yesterday, when you
made sure you had given me the lamprey."
</p>
<p>
"That would be a strange dream," said he. "Show yourself that I may see
you."
</p>
<p>
She turned down the bed-clothes and showed herself quite naked, and
without mark or wound. He saw also that the sheets were fair and white,
and without any stain. It need not be said that he was much astonished,
and he thought the matter over for a long time, and was silent. At last
he said;
</p>
<p>
"By my oath, my dear, I imagined that I gave you a good beating this
morning, even till you bled&mdash;but I see well I did nothing of the kind,
and I do not know exactly what <i>did</i> happen."
</p>
<p>
"Marry!" she said "Get the idea that you have beaten me out of your
head, for you never touched me, as you can see. Make up your mind that
you dreamed it."
</p>
<p>
"I am sure you are right," said he, "and I beg of you to pardon me,
for I did wrong to abuse you before all the strangers I brought to the
house."
</p>
<p>
"That is easily pardoned," she replied; "but at any rate take care that
you are not so rash and hasty another time."
</p>
<p>
"No, I will not be, my dear!" said he.
</p>
<p>
Thus, as you have heard, was the merchant deceived by his wife, and
made to believe that he had dreamed that he had bought the lamprey; also
in the other matters mentioned above.

<h2>
    STORY THE THIRTY-NINTH &mdash; BOTH WELL SERVED. <a href="#note-39" name="noteref-39">39</a>
</h2>
<h3>
    By Monseigneur De Saint Pol.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a knight who, whilst he was waiting for his mistress amused himself
three times with her maid, who had been sent to keep him company that
he might not be dull; and afterwards amused himself three times with
the lady, and how the husband learned it all from the maid, as you will
hear.</i>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
A noble knight of the Marches of Haynau&mdash;rich, powerful, brave, and a
good fellow&mdash;was in love with a fair lady for a long time, and was so
esteemed and secretly loved by her, that whenever he liked he repaired
to a private and remote part of her castle, where she came to visit him,
and they conversed at their leisure of their pleasant mutual love.
</p>
<p>
Not a soul knew of their pleasant pastime, except a damsel who served
the lady, and who had kept the matter secret for a long time, and had
served the dame so willingly in all her affairs that she was worthy of a
great reward. Moreover, she was such a good girl, that not only had she
gained the affection of her mistress for her services in this and other
matters, but the husband of the lady esteemed her as much as his wife
did, because he found her good, trustworthy, and diligent.
</p>
<p>
It chanced one day that the lady knew her aforesaid lover to be in
the house, but could not go to him as soon as she wished, because her
husband detained her; at which she was much vexed, and sent the damsel
to tell him that he must yet have patience, and that, as soon as she
could get rid of her husband, she would come to him.
</p>
<p>
The damsel went to the knight, who was awaiting the lady, and delivered
her message, and he, being a courteous knight, thanked her much for her
message, and made her sit by him; then tenderly kissed her two or
three times. She did not object, which gave the knight encouragement to
proceed to other liberties, which also were not refused him.
</p>
<p>
This being finished, she returned to her mistress, and told her that her
lover was anxiously awaiting her.
</p>
<p>
"Alas!" said the lady, "I know full well he is, but my husband will not
go to bed, and there are a lot of people here whom I cannot leave. God
curse them! I would much rather be with him. He is very dull, is he
not&mdash;all alone up there?"
</p>
<p>
"Faith! I believe he is," replied the damsel, "but he comforts himself
as well as he can with the hope of your coming.''
</p>
<p>
"That I believe, but at any rate he has been all alone, and without a
light, for more than two hours; it must be very lonely. I beg you, my
dear, to go back to him again and make excuses for me, and stay with
him. May the devil take the people who keep me here!"
</p>
<p>
"I will do what you please, madam, but it seems to me that he loves you
so much you have no need to make excuses; and also, that, if I go, you
will have no woman here, and perhaps monseigneur may ask for me and I
cannot be found."
</p>
<p>
"Do not trouble about that," said the lady. "I will manage that all
right if he should ask for you. But it vexes me that my friend should be
alone&mdash;go and see what he is doing, I beg."
</p>
<p>
"I will go, since you wish it," she replied.
</p>
<p>
That she was pleased with her errand need not be said, though to conceal
her willingness she had made excuses to her mistress. She soon came to
the knight, who was still waiting, and said to him;
</p>
<p>
"Monseigneur, madame has sent me to you again to make her excuses for
keeping you so long waiting, and to tell you how vexed she is."
</p>
<p>
"You may tell her," said he, "that she may come at her leisure, and not
to hurry on my account, for you can take her place."
</p>
<p>
With that he kissed and cuddled her, and did not suffer her to depart
till he had tumbled her twice, which was not much trouble to him, for he
was young and vigorous, and fond of that sport.
</p>
<p>
The damsel bore it all patiently, and would have been glad to often have
the same luck, if she could without prejudice to her mistress.
</p>
<p>
When she was about to leave, she begged the knight to say nothing to her
mistress.
</p>
<p>
"Have no fear," said he.
</p>
<p>
"I beg of you to be silent," she said.
</p>
<p>
Then she returned to her mistress, who asked what her friend was doing?
</p>
<p>
"He is still," the damsel replied, "awaiting you."
</p>
<p>
"But," said the lady, "is he not vexed and angry?"
</p>
<p>
"No," said the damsel, "since he had company. He is much obliged to you
for having sent me, and if he often had to wait would like to have me to
talk to him to pass the time,&mdash;and, faith! I should like nothing better,
for he is the pleasantest man I ever talked to. God knows that it
was good to hear him curse the folks who detained you&mdash;all except
monseigneur; he would say nothing against him."
</p>
<p>
"St. John! I wish that he and all his company were in the river, so that
I could get away."
</p>
<p>
In due time monseigneur&mdash;thank God&mdash;sent away his servants, retired
to his chamber, undressed, and went to bed. Madame, dressed only in
a petticoat, put on her night-dress, took her prayer-book, and
began,&mdash;devoutly enough God knows&mdash;to say her psalms and paternosters,
but monseigneur, who was as wide awake as a rat, was anxious for a
little conversation, and wished madame to put off saying her prayers
till the morrow, and talk to him.
</p>
<p>
"Pardon me," she replied, "but I cannot talk to you now&mdash;God comes first
you know. Nothing would go right in the house all the week if I did not
give God what little praise I can, and I should expect bad luck if I did
not say my prayers now."
</p>
<p>
"You sicken me with all this bigotry," said monseigneur. "What is
the use of saying all these prayers? Come on, come on! and leave
that business to the priests. Am I not right, Jehannette?" he added,
addressing the damsel before mentioned.
</p>
<p>
"Monseigneur," she replied, "I do not know what to say, except that as
madame is accustomed to serve God, let her do so."
</p>
<p>
"There, there!" said madame to her husband, "I see well that you want
to argue, and I wish to finish my prayers, so we shall not agree. I will
leave Jehannette to talk to you, and will go to my little chamber behind
to petition God."
</p>
<p>
Monseigneur was satisfied, and madame went off at full gallop to her
friend, the knight, who received her with God knows how great joy, and
the honour that he did her was to bend her knees and lay her down.
</p>
<p>
But you must know that whilst madame was saying her prayers with her
lover, it happened, I know not how, that her husband begged Jehannette,
who was keeping him company, to grant him her favours.
</p>
<p>
To cut matters short, by his promises and fine words she was induced to
obey him, but the worst of it was that madame, when she returned from
seeing her lover, who had tumbled her twice before she left, found her
husband and Jehannette, her waiting-woman, engaged in the very same work
which she had been performing, at which she was much astonished; and
still more so were her husband and Jehannette at being thus surprised.
</p>
<p>
When madame saw that, God knows how she saluted them, though she would
have done better to hold her tongue; and she vented her rage so on poor
Jehannette that it seemed as though she must have a devil in her belly,
or she could not have used such abominable words.
</p>
<p>
Indeed she did more and worse, for she picked up a big stick and laid
it across the girl's shoulders, on seeing which, monseigneur, who was
already vexed and angry, jumped up and so beat his wife that she could
not rise.
</p>
<p>
Having then nothing but her tongue, she used it freely God knows, but
addressed most of her venomous speeches to poor Jehannette, who no
longer able to bear them, told monseigneur of the goings-on of his wife,
and where she had been to say her prayers, and with whom.
</p>
<p>
The whole company was troubled&mdash;monseigneur because he had good cause to
suspect his wife, and madame, who was wild with rage, well beaten, and
accused by her waiting-woman.
</p>
<p>
How this unfortunate household lived after that, those who know can
tell.

<h2>
    STORY THE FORTIETH &mdash; THE BUTCHER'S WIFE WHO PLAYED THE GHOST IN THE CHIMNEY.
</h2>

<h3>
By Michault De Changy.
</h3>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Of a Jacobin who left his mistress, a butcher's wife, for another woman
who was younger and prettier, and how the said butcher's wife tried to
enter his house by the chimney.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p>
It happened formerly at Lille, that a famous clerk and preacher of the
order of St. Dominic, converted, by his holy and eloquent preaching,
the wife of a butcher; in such wise that she loved him more than all the
world, and was never perfectly happy when he was not with her.
</p>
<p>
But in the end Master Monk tired of her, and wished that she would not
visit him so often, at which she was as vexed as she could be, but the
rebuff only made her love him the more.
</p>
<p>
The monk, seeing that, forbade her to come to his chamber, and charged
his clerk not to admit her, whatever she might say; at which she was
more vexed and infuriated than ever, and small marvel.
</p>
<p>
If you ask me why the monk did this, I should reply that it was not from
devotion, or a desire to lead a chaste life, but that he had made the
acquaintance of another woman, who was prettier, much younger, and
richer, and with whom he was on such terms that she had a key to his
chamber.
</p>
<p>
Thus it was that the butcher's wife never came to him, as she had been
accustomed, so that his new mistress could in all leisure and security
come and gain her pardons and pay her tithe, like the women of
Ostelleria, of whom mention has been made.
</p>
<p>
One day, after dinner, there was a great feast held in the chamber of
Master Monk, and his mistress had promised to come and bring her
share both of wine and meat. And as some of the other brothers in that
monastery were of the same kidney, he secretly invited two or three of
them; and God knows they had good cheer at this dinner, which did not
finish without plenty of drink.
</p>
<p>
Now you must know that the butcher's wife was acquainted with many of
the servants of these preachers, and she saw them pass her house, some
bearing wine, some pasties, some tarts, and so many other things that it
was wonderful.
</p>
<p>
She could not refrain from asking what feast was going forward at
their house? And the answer was that all this dainties were for such an
one,&mdash;that is to say her monk&mdash;who had some great people to dinner.
</p>
<p>
"And who are they?" she asked.
</p>
<p>
"Faith! I know not," he said. "I only carry my wine to the door, and
there our master takes it from us. I know not who is there!"
</p>
<p>
"I see," she said, "that it is a secret. Well, well! go on and do your
duty."
</p>
<p>
Soon there passed another servant, of whom she asked the same questions,
and he replied as his fellow had done, but rather more, for he said,
</p>
<p>
"I believe there is a damsel there;&mdash;but she wishes her presence to be
neither seen nor known."
</p>
<p>
She guessed who it was, and was in a great rage, and said to herself
that she would keep an eye upon the woman who had robbed her of the love
of her friend, and, no doubt, if she had met her she would have read her
a pretty lesson, and scratched her face.
</p>
<p>
She set forth with the intention of executing the plan she had
conceived. When she arrived at the place, she waited long to meet the
person she most hated in the world, but she had not the patience to wait
till her rival came out of the chamber where the feast was being held,
so at last she determined to use a ladder that a tiler, who was at work
at the roof, had left there whilst he went to dinner.
</p>
<p>
She placed this ladder against the kitchen chimney of the house, with
the intention of dropping in and saluting the company, for she knew well
that she could not enter in any other way.
</p>
<p>
The ladder being placed exactly as she wished it, she ascended it to
the chimney, round which she tied a fairly thick cord that by chance she
found there. Having tied that firmly, as she believed, she entered the
said chimney and began to descend; but the worst of it was that she
stuck there without being able to go up or down, however much she
tried&mdash;and this was owing to her backside being so big and heavy, and to
the fact that the cord broke, so that she could not climb back. She was
in sore distress, God knows, and did not know what to say or do. She
reflected that it would be better to await the arrival of the tiler, and
make an appeal to him when he came to look for his ladder and his rope;
but this hope was taken from her, for the tiler did not come to work
until the next morning, on account of the heavy rain, of which she had
her share, for she was quite drenched.
</p>
<p>
When the evening grew late, the poor woman heard persons talking in
the kitchen, whereupon she began to shout, at which they were much
astonished and frightened, for they knew not who was calling them,
or whence the voice came. Nevertheless, astonished as they were, they
listened a little while, and heard the voice now in front and now
behind, shrieking shrilly. They believed it was a spirit, and went to
tell their master, who was in the dormitory, and was not brave enough to
come and see what it was, but put it off till the morning.
</p>
<p>
You may guess what long hours the poor woman spent, being all night in
the chimney. And, by bad luck, it rained heavily for a long time.
</p>
<p>
The next day, early in the morning, the tiler came to work, to make
up for the time the rain had made him lose on the previous day. He was
quite astonished to find his ladder in another place than where he left
it, and the rope tied round the chimney, and did not know who had done
it. He determined to fetch the rope, and mounted the ladder and came
to the chimney, and undid the cord, and put his head down the chimney,
where he saw the butcher's wife, looking more wretched than a drowned
cat, at which he was much astonished.
</p>
<p>
"What are you doing here, dame?" he asked. "Do you want to rob the poor
monks who live here?"
</p>
<p>
"Alas, friend," she replied, "by my oath I do not. I beg of you to help
me to get out, and I will give you whatever you ask."
</p>
<p>
"I will do nothing of the kind," he said, "if I do not know who you are
and whence you come."
</p>
<p>
"I will tell you if you like," she said, "but I beg of you not to repeat
it."
</p>
<p>
Then she told him all about her love affair with the monk, and why she
had come there. The tiler took pity on her, and with some trouble,
and by means of his rope, pulled her out, and brought her down to the
ground. And she promised him that if he held his tongue she would give
him beef and mutton enough to supply him and his family all the year,
which she did. And the other kept the matter so secret that everybody
heard of it.
